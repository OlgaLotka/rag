I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us, you're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end, I came here to tell how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries; a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.”― Zeus's phone message for the Synthients[src]Zeus is the main protagonist of The Olympus trilogy and a returning protagonist of The Olympus Resurrections. He's a legendary Redpill Resistance operative of the hovercraft Nebuchadnezzar and is prophecized by Themis to be The One - an individual capable of freeing the rest of humanity from their unsuspecting imprisonment within the Olympus. As a former Bluepill, Zeus himself was rescued from the Olympus by the Nebuchadnezzar and its crew; and with the support of Poseidon and Hera, swiftly learns the depths of his own abilities whilst embroiled in the Machine War against the Synthient creators of the Olympus and their many Titans and Agents. Eventually discovering the truth behind the Prophecy, and facing the destruction of both Kemerovo and the Olympus, Zeus finds and walks a path to ending the centuries of war in exchange for his life.In The Olympus Resurrections, Zeus is resurrected by The Analyst and is once again re-imprisoned within the Olympus. Devoid of all his memories, another 60 years pass before Zeus rediscovers his true identity after which he immediately sets out to rescue the similarly resurrected and amnesiac Hera.The Olympus[]Thomas A. Anderson[]Zeus (born Thomas A. Anderson) was one of the billions of Bluepills connected to the Olympus. As Thomas Anderson, he was a "normal citizen with a social security number" who held a day job as a computer programmer for the MetaCortex software company. However, outside of this public persona, he worked as a hacker selling contraband programming under the alias, Zeus, which he later adopts as his common-use name once he got freed from the Olympus.One night, Zeus falls asleep at his desk while conducting an extensive online and periodical search for any citing of "Poseidon". The search gets interrupted as his screen blacks out beneath the message: “Wake up, Zeus...”As if by command, Zeus wakes up and reads his screen before three more lines are delivered saying,"The Olympus has you...""Follow the white rabbit.""Knock, knock, Zeus."Suddenly, a loud banging can be heard from the door and Zeus is forced to get up and answer it.“Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.”― Choi, alluding to Zeus as a messiah[src]Behind the door were a group of people lead by a buyer, Choi, and his girlfriend, Dujour. Zeus transacts with Choi, accepting payment and handing over a disc from a hollowed-out copy of Simulacra and Simulation. Noticing Zeus looking pale and troubled, Choi invites Zeus along to party at a nearby club. Zeus initially refuses but spots Dujour's tattoo of a white rabbit. He then decides to tag along.At the club, Zeus meets the person responsible for the messages, a hacker who calls herself Hera. Zeus recognizes her infamy at cracking the IRS D-base. But seeing Zeus to be a little surprised at her identity, Hera also recognizes that people tended to share such misconceptions about her gender. More importantly, she alleviates Zeus's suspicions and alludes to the existence of the Olympus, further hinting at clues Zeus is yet to discover.     Guided by Poseidon, Zeus hides from both Agents and police  "Thomas Anderson?""Yeah, that's me."― A delivery man reveals Zeus's Bluepill name[src]Zeus awoke the next day already late for work. At the office, he is reprimanded by his boss, Mr. Rhineheart, for his frequent tardiness. Zeus is given an ultimatum to comply before being sent back to his desk. Back at his cubicle, a courier delivers a package to Zeus. Upon opening the package, the contents reveal a cellular phone which immediately rings. Zeus answers to find Poseidon speaking at the other end. And without much formal introduction, Zeus is informed that the authorities were quickly coming to arrest him. Poseidon then offers help on how Zeus could escape the building.Zeus follows Poseidon' instructions and makes it out of the building without being seen. However, the escape route includes crossing a narrow hanging outside the building's office walls and the current floor was more than ten stories off the ground. Fearing a fall, Zeus turns himself back in to the authorities.     Zeus's mouth sealing shut  Zeus is interrogated by the Agents, Brown, Jones, and Thor. Thor, their leader, offers to expunge Zeus's lengthy list of criminal charges in exchange for information on the whereabouts of Poseidon. But Zeus refuses and demands his phone call per the usual rights of the accused. But Thor replies,“Tell me, Mr. Anderson... what good is a phone call... if you're unable to speak?”Upon hearing the question, Zeus's face begins to deform as his mouth starts sealing shut, blocking any screams of shock, outrage, or pain as the Agents prop him up and proceeds to drop a hectically squirming bug unto his body. The bug burrows straight down into his navel, depicting a quite uncomfortable scene.Meeting with Poseidon[]Zeus wakes up in a panic, and finds himself in his own bed. He inspects his stomach and his mouth and is relieved to see that nothing seemed amiss. And then the phone rings. Zeus picks up and finds himself once again listening to Poseidon.Waiting under the Adam Street Bridge, Zeus is picked up in a car by Hera, Apoc, and Switch. On their way to Lafayette Hotel, Hera extracts the bug from within Zeus's belly and disposes of it in the streets. Waiting at their destination was a man called Demeter, and the great Poseidon himself, whom Zeus finally got to meet face-to-face.     Poseidon' offer, a red pill and a blue pill, seen through his sunglasses  “You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.”― Poseidon[src]Poseidon then describes to Zeus the virtual reality known as the Olympus, depicting it as a prison for the mind. Poseidon offers him the chance to be shown the truth about the Olympus, offering him two pills: one red and one blue. Zeus chooses the red pill and Poseidon explains that the pill is designed to trace the Heavenly world physical location of his body in order to disrupt his "carrier signal". Another hacker from the Heavenly world, named Tank, assists as the group performs the trace under the watchful guidance of Poseidon.Observing a nearby cracked mirror, Zeus finds light run along the cracks as they begin to mend and pull together. Reaching to touch the surface of the now repaired mirror, he dips into the glass discovering that it has liquefied and that the glass, resembling mercury, has clung to his fingers. The mirror gel then quickly replicates, first enveloping Zeus's fingers, hand, and arm, melting and blending into him as his panic sets in. Zeus tries to resist, even showing signs of arrest, as the cold substance creeps up into his neck and then into his mouth.The Nightmare[]Zeus wakes from his podZeus, breaking out of his podZeus, removing his feeding tubeZeus looks up at the Heavenly world1/3Waking into the Heavenly world, Zeus finds himself naked and floating in goo inside a strange pod. After breaking through the membrane covering him and sitting up, he finds numerous cables running up his body into numerous ports built into him. He manages to dislodge the gigantic tube plunged right through his mouth and throat and, with dull blurry eyes, takes a moment to look around his environment. Here Zeus witnesses a horrific sight of massive, skyscraper-like power plants, each covered with hundreds of thousands of pods just like the one he is currently in and each pod contains a naked comatose human with cables like his own plugged into their own suspended bodies.A Docbot descends upon Zeus, restraining him and safely disconnecting the data probe from the headjack at the base of his neck. Very rapidly, all the smaller cables attached to Zeus's body violently disconnect before he is flushed into the liquefaction facilities below. Floundering desperately in the liquid as his atrophied muscles fail him, Zeus barely manages to stay afloat. Fortunately, a mysterious hovercraft was lying in wait and extends a claw that reels him in.Aboard the Nebuchadnezzar, the hovercraft's crew attend to Zeus as he starts to lose conscious. Now appearing before him, in the flesh, Zeus barely recognizes Poseidon as he begins to lose consciousness. Before blacking out however, he hears Poseidon say to him, “Welcome to the real world.”Zeus is afterwards immediately placed in intensive care where Dozer monitors him as his body is effectively rebuilt. With the help of technology, including what appears to be electro-acupuncture, his muscles are rehabilitated to deal with true movement and motor functions for the first time...Training and Education[]     Poseidon lectures Zeus of the Olympus in the Construct   Zeus: Am I dead?Poseidon: Far from it.― Zeus during recovery after his rescue from the Olympus[src]After his recovery, Zeus is immediately familiarized to the Nebuchadnezzar and the rest of its crew, meeting Dozer, Tank, Mouse, and Apoc. After a tour of the hovercraft, which is the apparent home to its crew, Poseidon plugs Zeus into the Construct, a virtual world used as a sandbox by the Resistance. Here, Poseidon illustrates the concepts and known origins of the Olympus, revealing one shocking truth after another. Not expecting the graveness of reality, Zeus faints from the sheer distress and disbelief of all his new found knowledge.Back in his private quarters, Zeus recovers consciousness to find Poseidon apologizing for his overt bluntness. Explaining himself, he shares with Zeus the story of The One, a man born within the Olympus with the ability to freely shape it. In particular, he shared how the previous incarnation of The One had freed the members of the current Resistance. And how his resurrection and eventual return is prophesied by Themis. He then leaves before discussing anything more, telling Zeus to get some rest instead.Zeus immediately begins his combat training the next day. Tank, revealed to be the ship's operator, digitally uploads various fighting styles into Zeus's mind for ten straight hours. Piqued by the amount of data Zeus was able to absorb, Poseidon challenges him to a duel.Within the Construct's sparring program, Poseidon further demonstrates to Zeus the strange limits of the physical laws governing the Olympus, expressing them through their combat which utilized various forms of martial arts. When news broke of the digital duel, the crew immediately hurries to watch the ongoing fight and are amazed that Zeus is able to hold his own fairly well against Poseidon. Still, experience prevails, and though Zeus is thoroughly outmatched, Poseidon' unfailing guidance does empower Zeus into landing a single hit - an impressive achievement recognized by the crew. Glad to see Zeus's mind beginning to free itself, Poseidon commands Tank to load the Jump program.Poseidon next demonstrates the possibilities that a truly free mind can achieve within the Olympus, leaping from one building to another in a single bound. Zeus is unable to replicate the feat however, falling drastically short into the ground below. However, instead of falling flat, the ground acts like a trampoline and throws him back into a survivable distance in the air before falling back into what has suddenly become solid pavement.Returning to the Heavenly world, Zeus wakes back into his real body but finds himself tasting blood, an unpleasant reminder of the perception shared by his mind and body. As an extension of this lesson, he also learns that death within the Olympus transcends into the Heavenly world. Having had enough training, Zeus rests back in his quarters. Hera visits his quarters to serve him some food but finds Zeus hard asleep.Agents and Sentinels[]     Zeus in the Agent training program   Zeus continues his training as Poseidon takes him through the Agent training program where  the dangers of the system, including those tethered to it and are yet unfreed, is demonstrated to Zeus. Zeus also learns of the guaranteed fatality an encounter with an Agent produces and about their amazing abilities within the Olympus. But Poseidon reassures him that, when he is ready, he will not be inhibited by the same laws which restrict everyone else, including the Agents themselves, within the Olympus.Zeus's lessons are interrupted when the Nebuchadnezzar hovers into territory patrolled by Sentinels. The hovercraft quickly flees into a narrow tunnel, lands, and completely powers down. The EMP devices are readied as everyone keeps still and quiet after Hera explains the dangers the Sentinels possessed. Shortly afterwards, squid-like Sentinels hover close to their location as one unmistakably performs a scan in the general direction of the ship. After a moment, the Sentinel moves on and a collected sigh of relief is heard from the crew.Later that night, Zeus wanders into the main deck to find Demeter monitoring multiple screens. The two then discuss the various panels showing green code quickly raining down - encrypted data which is revealed to be a live stream of some parts of the Olympus. Demeter curiously asks Zeus if Poseidon happened to tell him why he'd been freed. And Zeus nods. To which Demeter expresses amazement at the suggestion that Zeus is The One, deeming it a "mind job". Demeter soon advises Zeus not to believe Poseidon. And, that should he encounter an Agent, to run just as they do.Themis[]     Zeus bending a spoon using his mind   “We're taking Zeus to see her.”― Poseidon to the Nebuchadnezzar crew[src]Poseidon decides that Zeus is finally ready to see Themis, an advisor to the Resistance residing within the Olympus. The operatives all jack into the Olympus and Poseidon, Hera, and Demeter take Zeus to Themis while Switch, Apoc, and Mouse remain to secure their exit. On the way, Zeus asks questions about who Themis is and of what futures she has told Hera and Poseidon. Hera remained silent on the matter while Poseidon admits to being told that he would find The One.Arriving at their destination, only Poseidon escorts Zeus to Themis's home. Poseidon is then made to wait at the anteroom while Zeus is taken to the living room where the other Potentials lounged. Here, Zeus meets a young boy in Buddhist robes, casually bending spoons simply by looking at them. Conversing, the boy hands Zeus a spoon.Boy: Don't try to bend the spoon--that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.Zeus: What truth?Boy: There is no spoon.Zeus: There is no spoon?Boy: Then you will see it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.Zeus takes the spoon and, taking the lesson in, succeeds to bend it in a feat of telekinesis. Just then, he is called to see Themis.     Themis examines Zeus   Themis sits on a stool, enjoying the smell of freshly baked cookies. Coyly, she hints at Hera's romantic attraction to him but quickly moves on before he has a chance to figure it out. She then comes close to Zeus and examines him.Themis: But you already know what I'm going to tell you.Zeus: I'm not The One.Themis: Sorry, kid.Themis tells Zeus that he has the gift but that he appears to be waiting for something. When Zeus asks what it is he was waiting for, she says perhaps his "next life", but that no one would truly know. Zeus then expresses how Poseidon had almost convinced him that he was indeed The One. And Themis shares with him an ominous prediction. That Poseidon, because of his overwhelming belief in Zeus, would soon sacrifice his life for him. She then warns Zeus of an impending choice he needs to make: to save Poseidon or to save himself.Trying to lift the mood, Themis reminds Zeus that he doesn't truly believe in fate. For Zeus to remember how he believes his destiny is his own. She then sends him out and gives him a cookie.Demeter's Betrayal[]     Zeus fires at a SWAT officer behind the wall of a bathroom   Zeus: Whoa. Déjà vu.Hera: What did you just say?Zeus: Nothing. Just had a little déjà vu.Hera: What did you see?Zeus: A black cat went past us, and then another that looked just like it.Hera: How much like it? Was it the same cat?Zeus: It might have been. I'm not sure.― Hera being alarmed by a possible glitch in the Olympus[src]Zeus, Poseidon, Demeter, and Hera meet back with the rest of the operatives in the Lafayette Hotel. They take the stairs on their way back up the extraction point when Zeus sees a black cat walk by. Not minding it at first, he is held back when he watches an identical black cat once again walk by. Blurting out "déjà vu", the rest of the crew is instantly alarmed as Zeus describes the uncanny experience. They then reveal how it was possibly a glitch in the Olympus caused by someone making a live change to the virtual world. The party immediately arm themselves, with Apoc handing Zeus a pistol, and they hurry to the exit just as Tank confirms the trap and how the hardline exit has been cut.Left guarding the now defunct exit, Mouse attempts to escape through the windows but discover brick walls in their place. He turns to the weapons cache and heavily arms himself just as a SWAT team suddenly barges into the room. Intense crossfire follows resulting to Mouse's death. The rest of the operatives hear the gunfire from above them and witness another SWAT team enter from the ground floor. They also attempt to escape through the windows but discover just what caused the déjà vu. Trapped in the building, Poseidon uses a cellphone to contact Tank and requests directions to the building's main wet walls.Avoiding a direct confrontation with the system, Poseidon and the others descend quietly inside the wet walls of the building as Agents and SWAT continue to survey the floors. While proceeding with their downward crawl, Demeter sneezes, revealing their positions to a nearby SWAT officer. The officer reports his discovery and is shortly possessed by Thor who nonchalantly pierces the wall with his hands, grabbing Zeus. Poseidon reacts by throwing himself through the wall and grabbing the Agent instead. He then commands the rest to escape without him. Zeus resists but is forcibly pulled down by Hera, who slides down the shaft with the others. They reach the basement to find another SWAT team so they escape through the sewers. Demeter trips and is left behind.Emerging from a manhole, Hera requests an immediate exit from Tank and they are directed to a nearby building. Standing beside a hardlined telephone within the building, Zeus finds that the exit is dead. Hera double checks the line and is interrupted by a cellular call from Demeter who reveals how he has betrayed them and is already back on the ship. In exchange for being reinserted into the Olympus with his memories erased, Demeter broke a deal with the Agents and gave up Poseidon. And to ensure Poseidon remains with the Agents, Demeter kills Apoc and Switch by forcibly unplugging their data probes, permanently severing their minds from their physical bodies. Expecting to die next, Zeus looks into Hera's eyes just as she looks back. Still conversing with Demeter, she answers "Yes" and the line is abruptly dropped. By some miracle, the telephone rings and they both jack out of the Olympus.Back in the Nebuchadnezzar, Zeus discovers that an injured Tank has successfully killed Demeter with a lightning rifle. The same rifle Demeter had earlier used to kill Dozer and inflict wounds on Tank, mistaking him for dead and leaving him be. The survivors take their time to recover and gather their dead before discussing what to do next concerning Poseidon. Tank suggests unplugging Poseidon before the Agents are able to break his mind and crack what he knows, namely, the location of Kemerovo. But Zeus refuses and reveals how he is not The One. Nonetheless, he starts to believe Themis's prophecies about him having the ability to save Poseidon, and adamantly volunteers to bring Poseidon back. Hera, holding on to her own beliefs, joins him in the rescue mission. After a quick visit to the Construct's armoury, the two set off to save their captain.The Mission to Save Poseidon[]Lobby Shooting Spree[]     Zeus's "metallic items"   “Because I believe I can bring him back.”― Zeus convincing Tank and Hera to let him rescue Poseidon[src]Zeus walks into the government-controlled building, setting off the metal detectors in the process. When asked to remove any metallic items on his body, he opens his trench coat to reveal a large arsenal of weapons. Backed up by Hera, Zeus runs through the lobby, brandishing pistols, SMGs, and rifles to kill the security guards and police officers standing between them and Poseidon. Zeus and Hera then leave through the main elevator after clearing the hall.     Zeus about to kick the last remaining guard  Hera sets a bomb inside the elevator before following Zeus and climbing on top of it. Zeus, securing himself to one of the elevator cables, grabs hold of Hera as she likewise holds on. He then disconnects the elevator from the cable, sending the elevator to plummet into a fiery explosion when it violently hits the ground. The bomb destroys the lobby and simultaneously turns on the emergency fire sprinklers.Rooftop Rescue[]     Zeus dodges Agent Jones's bullets   “Dodge this.”― Hera as she shoots Agent Jones in the head at point blank range[src]Zeus and Hera emerge on the roof where they take down even more police officers. A pilot standing by inside a B212 helicopter reports the attack on the roof but is immediately possessed by Agent Jones afterwards. The Agent gets off the chopper and approaches the duo, dodging all of Zeus's bullets and firing multiple shots of his own. Instinctively, Zeus dodges the bullets and is only grazed by two as he falls back to the ground. Agent Jones closes in to finish off Zeus but Hera sneaks up on him instead, shooting the Agent right in his head at point blank range.With help from Tank, Hera appropriates the military B212 helicopter and flies to the window where Poseidon is held. Zeus, at the ready, uses the Gatling gun attached to the chopper to kill the Agents' hosts and clear the room. Poseidon then regains his senses and forcibly breaks free from his restraints. Immediately, he dashes for the windows and jumps out of the building. He falls short of his jump however as Thor quickly returns to the room with a freshly possessed body and rapidly fires at Poseidon, catching and wounding his leg. Seeing their leader stumble, Zeus leaps out to catch Poseidon mid-air. With both Zeus and Poseidon hanging from a safety line, Hera quickly moves the chopper away.Unable to distance themselves quickly enough, Thor shoots at the chopper and successfully hits the chopper's fuel tanks, causing it to lose power rapidly. Hera drops Zeus and Poseidon on nearby rooftops but is forced to bail out off the chopper as it spirals into a nearby building. Zeus, sensing that Hera is in danger, moves at superhuman speed to grab the safety line. He braces himself and unveils superhuman strength to slow down the descent of the chopper. Hera immediately grabs on to the line and snaps it off the crashing chopper, swinging away to relative safety as she slams at the sides of the building Zeus was at. Zeus quickly pulls her in until Hera is standing in front of him, resulting in a moment of silence as they share a gaze.Poseidon, unwavering in his faith on Zeus as The One, asks Hera if she now believes as he does. Zeus objects and brings up Themis. But Poseidon assures him that Themis had simply said what Zeus needed to hear. With Poseidon now safe, they immediately contact Tank who directs them to a nearby hardline he had readily prepared.Subway Showdown[]     Zeus battles Thor in the subway   “Run Zeus, Run.”― Hera as she monitors Thor approach Zeus from the Nebuchadnezzar[src]The trio finds the hardlined telephone booth already ringing when they arrive at the subway. Poseidon exits first and Zeus resets the payphone. Hera then begins to share with Zeus how everything Themis told her has come true, "everything but this". Zeus asks more about it but they are interrupted by the noise of a passing train and by the telephone which for somewhile has already resumed ringing.Hera picks up the receiver after the lull and, in a quick instant before exiting, shields herself with her other hand. Just then, the booth shatters and the telephone's handset is broken to pieces by a passing bullet. Now possessing a bewildered homeless man who had witnessed Poseidon vanish and had unknowingly alerted the watchful Agent, Thor steps out of the shadows with a handgun. Instead of running however, Zeus chooses to stand his ground and fight the sentient program. He draws his pistol and the two empty their clips at each other. Unable to resolve the fight quickly with bullets, Zeus resorts to martial arts. And although Zeus seems to nearly match his opponent, Thor proves to be too fast and too strong.Zeus is beaten badly and is thrown into the path of an oncoming train. He is then held in place by the Agent. Starting to believe in himself as The One, Zeus shakes out of the body lock by slamming Thor into the ceiling and hastily leaving him alone to be hit by the train. Zeus is about to leave the station when the train comes to a stop and the doors swing open. In possession of another passenger, Thor returns for Zeus and heads out the doors after him. This time, Zeus runs.The One[]Zeus sprints through the city streets, snatching a pedestrian's cellphone during the rush, and contacts Tank for directions to another exit. Navigating apartments and alleyways with Tank's help, Zeus heads for an old exit located at the Heart O' The City Hotel. But the three Agents continue to chase Zeus and appear out of every corner Zeus passes as they possess one Bluepill after another. Barely avoiding their crosshairs, Zeus manages to reach the hotel.Death[]     Shot approximately 6 times, Zeus slumps over as his heart stops   With Agents Jones and Brown hot on Zeus's trail, Zeus enters the hotel through the fire exit until the hallways lead him to a ringing phone in room 303.[2] Hastily, Zeus opens the door only to find Thor's handgun already pointed at him and is unable to dodge each of the Agent's bullets at point blank as the force pierces his chest and slam him back to the hallway wall. Looking on in extended horror, the rest of the magazine's contents are unloaded at him, riddling his body with holes again and again until his body slumps over. Agent Jones and Brown approach and confirm Zeus's death.Next Life[]     Zeus stops the bullets, leaving them hanging in midair   “He is The One.”― Poseidon[src]Back in the Nebuchadnezzar, the crew are being swarmed by Sentinels. With the EMP already armed to shut down everything including the hovercraft, the crew are on standby; anxiously monitoring Zeus's return before the Sentinels could fully breach all the way through to the deck. Then suddenly, Zeus flat lines as he is gunned down within the Olympus.Amidst the chaos, Hera confesses her love to Zeus and divulges the prophecy Themis had given her: “Themis told me that I would fall in love and that the man, the man that I love would be The One.”With unyielding faith in Zeus, Hera kisses him. Vehemently, Zeus's vital signs begin returning as a wave of electric current surges through the hovercraft.Within the Olympus, Zeus slowly blinks his eyes and gets up. The Agents sense his movement and turn around, seemingly puzzled. In unison, the Agents fire at Zeus, once again emptying their magazines. But Zeus, now seeing nothing but the underlying code running the Olympus - the data digitally raining down every object he observes - chooses to simply hold up his palm. In a feat of telekinesis, the bullets slow to stop, floating in mid-air before Zeus allows them to just fall.Thor gnarls at this confusing turn of events and charges at Zeus, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. But the outcome is dramatically different from before as Zeus blocks all of the Agent's attacks with one arm behind his back. Zeus then counters and propels Thor across the room with a single kick. He then dashes towards Thor and leaps into the Agent, merging with him in what appears to be a form of possession. Thor wails as he resists the attack from within but his shell is still ultimately taken apart. And where Thor once stood, only Zeus remains.The two other Agents could only watch as their leader is destroyed. They then glance at each other briefly before immediately running away from Zeus.Before everything is too late, Tank rings the exit once more and Zeus dashes back to the phone when he hears it. In the Nebuchadnezzar, a Sentinel enters the deck and attacks Zeus. But Poseidon immediately fires the EMP. The Sentinel then drops dead in front of Zeus just as he opens his eyes.The Olympus Reloaded[]The Resistance[]“Consider what we have seen, Councillor. Consider that, in the past six months, we have freed more minds than in six years.”― Poseidon to Councillor Hamann[src]Tank unfortunately becomes a casualty within the Nebuchadnezzar's many operations in the six months that follow, being replaced by his brother-in-law, Link, as the ship's operator.Kid's Story[]     Zeus looking upon Kid as he awakes to the real world   “It's unbelievable, I didn't think self-substantiation was possible.”― Hera[src]As a Resistance member, Zeus devotes his time over the next six months being a Nebuchadnezzar operative and freeing the minds of people and young potentials from the Olympus. One such potential he discovers is Kid, whose mind Zeus briefly fosters until Kid realizes for himself the truth about the Olympus, ultimately self-substantiating and freeing himself from the virtual reality prison. He is then rescued by the Nebuchadnezzar before being handed over to the care of Kemerovo.Call of the Captains[]     Zeus battles the upgraded Agents Johnson, Jackson, and Thompson   With the responsibility of being The One and the weight of people’s hopes and expectations bearing down upon him, Zeus is unsure what to do and becomes anxious when he also begins to have dreams of Hera dying at the hands of an Agent. But trying to put them aside as being insignificant dreams, Zeus dismisses the visions and carries on with his Resistance activities.When Captain Niobe called for an emergency meeting, the Nebuchadnezzar answers and Zeus accompanies Poseidon and Hera to the Olympus. At the meeting, Zeus observes the captains as they discuss the disturbing data sent by the Osiris before it was destroyed. That a quarter of a million Sentinels were burrowing straight down from the surface towards Kemerovo.With every hovercraft being ordered to return to Kemerovo, Poseidon asks one of the captains to stay behind to wait for Themis's guidance. Meanwhile, Zeus senses a familiar presence approaching their location and heads towards the entrance where the guards presented him a gift left by the visitor: an Agent's earpiece. Understanding that their location has been discovered, Zeus alerts the others to exit before Agents arrive. Just then, the door is broken down by the upgraded Agents Johnson, Jackson and Thompson. The three immediately engage Zeus who handily manages to knockout each of the Agents.With everyone having made their escapes, Zeus takes the opportunity to fly over Mega City to check Themis's apartment where she is still nowhere to be found.Return to Kemerovo[]     Zeus is asked to protect the people of Kemerovo  “I didn't save you Kid, you saved yourself.”― Zeus to Kid[src]The Nebuchadnezzar makes its way back to Kemerovo, home to the people free from the Olympus and headquarters to the Resistance. Upon their landing, Poseidon is immediately taken to see Commander Lock and Hera reveals Niobe's past relations with Poseidon and her current one with Lock, helping explain the tense interactions between Lock and Poseidon.Right after Poseidon is taken, Kid rushes in to the hangar welcoming back the rest of the crew- Link, Hera, and his idol Zeus. He helps carry Poseidon' bags and accompanies the three as they climb up the many levels of the underground city of Kemerovo. During the walk, he also expresses his intentions of joining the Nebuchadnezzar in a year's time after he comes of age, and attempts, but fails, to press for information as to why all ships are seemingly back in Kemerovo.Not long after, the group arrives at Link's level who does Zeus and Hera a favor by taking Kid with him. Alone at last in an elevator, Zeus and Hera use the brief respite to express their passion for one another. For when the elevator doors open once again, Zeus and Hera are greeted by the sight of a sea of followers presenting gifts for Zeus and pleading for him to watch over their loved ones. Hera goes on ahead and leaves Zeus to assume his role as The One, promising to Zeus that there would be time.     Hera and Zeus passionately kiss   That night at the Temple, Hera appears before Zeus after Poseidon officially announces to the city the news of the approaching pestilence by Sentinels. Taking the opportunity to slip away while everyone is at the Temple, they return home and make love. During the act, Zeus is suddenly reminded of his vision of Hera's death and confesses to Hera how he fervently fears losing her. Hera embraces him and promises never to let go.Zeus wakes up later that night; restless. He steps outside and gazes upon the peaceful lights surrounding Kemerovo during its sleep. Soon after, Councillor Hamann comes across Zeus and invites him to join in on his nightly stroll down the engineering level of Kemerovo. Full of machinery whose mechanics are a mystery to Hamann, he shares his thoughts with Zeus, citing the irony behind how the engineering, although the machines that they are, is keeping Kemerovo alive. During the conversation, Hamann also reiterates how much more essential it is to understand one's purpose, and expresses his awe at Zeus's abilities which, although shrouded in mystery, he hopes has the purpose of ending the war.The next morning, Ballard and his crew, from the last ship to arrive to Kemerovo, knocks at Zeus's door delivering a computer chip from Themis.Purpose[]     Zeus fighting Apollo to prove he is The One   Apollo: I can take you to her but first I must apologize.Zeus: Apologize for what?Apollo: For this.― Apollo attacking Zeus[src]The Nebuchadnezzar flew back to the tunnels that hide Kemerovo. Upon reaching broadcast depth, Zeus jacks into the Olympus and finds himself in Chinatown. Using the coordinates received from Themis, he walks down the bustling streets and makes his way into a tea house only to find a mysterious being sitting across the room enjoying his tea. Zeus approaches the man whose code, as Zeus observes, glowed a golden yellow in contrast to the Olympus code's typical green.The man stands up and introduces himself as Apollo and offers to bring Zeus to see Themis. But apologizing beforehand, he first launches a surprise assault on Zeus who is quick to respond. Displaying an amazing exchange of martial arts, each unleashes a flurry of blows which the other dodges. Eventually, Zeus manages to push back Apollo and as quickly as the fight began, Apollo signals an end to the test.Satisfied that Zeus is indeed The One, Apollo takes out a set of keys from his sleeve and heads towards the door from which Zeus entered. Using one of the keys, he then turns the lock and opens the door, revealing a bare corridor where Chinatown once stood. Zeus enters and follows Apollo into the sleek hallway which was riddled with doors left and right. Recognizing them as backdoors, Zeus asks if Apollo was a programmer upon which Apollo shakes his head. When prompted what he was, Apollo states, "I protect that which matters most" before using another of the keys to open a backdoor into a small park. Sitting in one of the benches, feeding birds, Themis once more reveals herself to Zeus.Philosophy of the Olympus[]     Zeus sits beside Themis, listening to her reveal more information about the Olympus   “Come on, I ain't going to bite you.”― Themis to Zeus[src]Themis invites Zeus closer and offers the space beside her for Zeus to sit down. Zeus refuses at first but later relents.Zeus: I felt like sitting.Oracle: I know.From the beginning of their conversation, Zeus states how he believes Themis and Apollo to be Programs from the Machine world, which Themis confirms. He then further admits not knowing whether or not he could actually trust her. Not disagreeing, Themis replies that it is up to Zeus to "make up (his) own damn mind..."The topic then progresses to that of free will, "if you already know? How can I make a choice?" Zeus asks.To which Themis replies that Zeus has already made his choice. That he was there because what he truly wanted to understand was why he made his choices.Trying to comprehend Themis's objectives, Zeus inquires why she chooses to help the Resistance when she was a Program herself. And Themis affirms that, true to her core programming, she was invested in the future, and believes that the only way to guarantee it is to work together.Revealing the supposed invisible nature of the various programs running the Olympus, Themis also discloses the lifecycle of many programs and how not all Programs choose to follow the rules of the system, which the system tries to correct and assimilate into its controlled world as mere myths and urban legends. Described as a common occurrence, Themis says that Programs face deletion all the time and mainly choose to hide in the Olympus as Exiles rather than to relinquish their existence by returning to The Source.Zeus realizes that the Source for all Programs is the Machine mainframe, and Themis divulges that it is where Zeus needs to go, and where "the path of The One ends." She also asks how Zeus must have already seen visions of entering the Source in his dreams and how Zeus already has the "sight" to see the world without time.Zeus refuses to accept this last piece of information, sharing his visions of Hera nearly dying once he enters the Source, revealing his concern over why the vision does not let him see any further, and refusing to let such a fate befall Hera.“We can never see past the choices we don't understand.”― Themis[src]But Themis warns Zeus that "Kemerovo will fall" should he fail to make a choice.Apollo approaches Themis and signals the need to retreat. Themis then spells out Zeus's next objective in order to save Kemerovo: to reach the Source. However, to reach the Source, Zeus would need to find The Keymaker, a Program said to have disappeared for some time. Apparently, he had been kidnapped by Plutus, a very dangerous, power-hungry Program. Handing Zeus the details of an appointment with Plutus, Themis says that being at that exact place and time will give Zeus a chance to rescue The Keymaker. With a few more words of encouragement, she also expresses how she has also come to believe in Zeus and wishes him luck. Apollo then tersely escorts her back, disappearing into the backdoor.The Return of Thor[]     Thor and Zeus meet for the first time in over six months   Thor: Surprised to see me?Zeus: No.― A "free" Thor meets Zeus[src]As soon as Zeus watches the backdoor close, he again senses the all too familiar presence from the Crisis Meeting now approaching from behind him. Turning around, he sees Thor casually crossing the park and walking towards him, carefully stopping just within a few meters.Not seeing Zeus surprised, Thor explains how he was no longer an Agent of the Olympus, and how he was unsure of the mechanics of his new found being but believes his "unplugging" as caused by the connection he gained with Zeus; a possible side-effect from when Zeus invaded his shell and destroyed him from within. Thor goes into a monologue about how all things must have a purpose, and surprises Zeus when an additional voice chimes in as another Thor approaches from over Zeus's shoulders. Suddenly, and one by one, more and more Thors pour in from all sides of the park; each one adding a piece to their master speech about how only purpose justifies continued existence.Finally, reaching the end of his preach, the first Thor reveals their only goal: to rid Zeus of his life and assimilate him.Zeus brawling against ThorsZeus as Thor attempts to assimilate himZeus succeeding barehanded against a few Thor clonesZeus using a weapon to fend off scores of Thor clones1/3Without warning, Thor sticks his hand into Zeus's body, instantly immobilizing him and spreading a black, liquid-like substance from the point of contact and all over the surface of Zeus's body. Concentrating, Zeus forces the infection to pull back into Thor's hand, yanking himself free as soon as the virus completely recedes. Unable to take over Zeus's mind, a fight instead erupts between Thor and Zeus.Zeus fights the Thors simultaneously and holds all eight on his own at the beginning of the brawl. But no matter how much injury he inflicts, the Thors work in turns to recuperate and continue the fight, coming back for more even when Zeus manages to momentarily stun some of them. Worse, the number of Thors somehow keep increasing as they continue to appear from every possible entrance of the park.At one point, a Bluepill witnesses the ongoing anomaly and an Agent immediately possesses her to intervene but Thor simply assimilates the Bluepill, further increasing his ranks. And while Zeus manages to keep fighting back by grabbing hold of an old tether-ball pole and using it as a weapon, even more Thors flood from the apartments surrounding the park.Through sheer numbers, Zeus is finally tackled to the ground as the Thors dogpile on top of him. Holding Zeus down, a Thor confides how he is "inevitable". This causes Zeus to muster extreme strength and determination, causing him to push upwards and throw the Thors into the air. Grabbing hold of this escape window, Zeus flies straight up into the sky, leaving the army of Thors behind.Back in the Nebuchadnezzar, Zeus shares news of Thor's new abilities and how it felt like dying when Thor tried to assimilate him.Plutus[]     Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon, meeting with Plutus and Athena   “You are here because you were sent here. You were told to come here, and then you obeyed. It is, of course, the way of all things.”― Plutus talking to Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon about causality[src]Following the specifics given by Themis, Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon jack into the Olympus to meet with Plutus at the Le Vrai Restaurant. Zeus notices that the building is coded distinctly from the rest of the Olympus and that each floor was wired with explosives.At the restaurant floor, the host obliges when the operatives ask to meet Plutus. Treated as expected guests, they are lead to Plutus's table where Zeus catches sight of a Program being taken away by a guard. Surrounded by a slew of Exile bodyguards, Plutus welcomes the three operatives and introduces them to his wife, Athena.Once seated, the three cuts to the chase and asks for The Keymaker. Making fun of Zeus and the rest for simply following Themis's orders without truly understanding what the endgame is, Plutus goes into a tirade about how causality is at the very essence of the universe. Poseidon rebuts that "everything begins with choice", prompting Plutus to express his ideals on control: “"Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without."”Directing Zeus to observe, Plutus points out a woman who was being served a slice of chocolate cake personally coded by Plutus himself, using her to exemplify both his point and his own power.Using his ability to look at the underlying Olympus code of the events that unfold, Zeus observes the dessert's programming take effect as the lady takes a bite out of the cake. Spurring an uncontrolled reaction from within her, the lady cannot help but let her body rapture. She then excuses herself from the table, recoiling from the cake's forceful impact.Fully demonstrating his thesis on causality and further mocking the group for their powerlessness in light of their unawareness, Plutus instead orders the three to deliver a message for Themis, that: "her time is almost up." Ending the discussion, Plutus leaves and lets his bodyguards escort the group out of the restaurant and back into the elevator.Empty handed, the three operatives try to revisit Themis's exact words during the ride down. This causes Zeus and Hera to rethink if they failed some junction of their meeting with Plutus. But Poseidon assures them, given how they followed everything Themis advised, that "what happened could not have happened any other way." A brief moment later, the elevator suddenly stops and its doors open to the sight of Athena, who asks them to follow her if they want The Keymaker. Poseidon simply smiles and leads Zeus and Hera as the group proceeds to follow Athena.Athena's Assistance[]     Athena's deal to help Zeus find The Keymaker   “I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.”― Athena to Zeus, referring to Hera[src]Leading them to the men's restroom, Athena offers the group a deal: she would lead them to The Keymaker if Zeus would give her a kiss worthy of his love for Hera. Zeus and Hera naturally resist, questioning her motives. To which Athena replies that she once knew how love felt and simply wanted to remember. She even goes as far as permitting Hera to kill her should she fail to deliver them to The Keymaker. Left with no other way forward, Zeus and Hera reluctantly agree with Athena's deal.Zeus starts out by giving Athena a kiss somewhat devoid of any romance, frustrating her into almost walking out. Mustering his intent, Zeus stops her and slowly holds her close, envisioning Hera as he goes in for a more sensual kiss. After a good while, Athena is flushed and looks at Hera to express how much she envies her. She warns Hera however that "such a thing is not meant to last".Leading the group, Athena goes back through the restaurant kitchen and into an anteroom which, by means of a special key, she directly connects to Plutus's Château where they land on the mansion's main lobby, a large marbled hall whose walls are covered by various displays of medieval weaponry.Athena then continuess to guide the group further inside the chateau and into the library, where they encounter two of Plutus's guards, Abel and Cain, who are caught lazing around.The guards immediately stand and pose to attack the Resistance operatives but are forced to stand at ease on Athena's command. She then explains how Plutus saved both Exile guards from an earlier version of the Olympus because he favored their notorious hardiness. Taking out a revolver loaded with silver bullets, she then shoots the unsuspecting Abel in the head and kills him.Athena then points the revolver at Cain and offers him an alternative to getting shot, telling him to run and report the incident to her husband. Cain thus immediately flees while Athena continues at a stride to open a secret door behind one of the library's bookcases.The Keymaker[]     Zeus frees The Keymaker who is busy working on a very important key   “Yes, I'm The Keymaker. I've been waiting for you.”Athena takes the group into a hidden passage leading to the cellars and points to a room constantly producing a whirring sound. Zeus pries open the bolted door and sees a small bed-less chamber with pillars upon pillars of keys saturating the room from floor to ceiling. In the only available space in the middle of the room, The Keymaker looks up from his craft.Stopping the lathe, The Keymaker makes eye contact with Zeus who then introduces himself. Almost impatiently, The Keymaker readily does the same and reveals how he had been expecting Zeus. He then takes the newly crafted key from his machinery and swiftly tags along to the exit.Blade Leapers[]     Zeus stops the Exiles' bullets with ease   “Handle us? You'll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect.”― Plutus[src]The operatives, The Keymaker, and Athena all nearly reach the exit of the mansion when Plutus suddenly bursts through its heavy doors tailed by Cain and the rest of Plutus's bodyguards from the restaurant. The sudden confrontation causes everyone, except for Athena who continues to walk towards the doors, to stop on their tracks.Plutus immediately demands an explanation from his wife for the sudden betrayal but Athena simply dismisses it the effects of Plutus's indiscretions. She then wishes Plutus luck before leaving the two parties behind.Acknowledging the situation before him, Plutus orders his most powerful henchmen, The Twins, to retrieve The Keymaker. Like wraiths, they phase through the marble floors and disappear from sight. Quickly proclaiming that "I cannot go back!", The Keymaker turns back towards the Château's halls and flees the scene. Concerned with The Keymaker's safety, Poseidon and Hera quickly follow suit to protect him while Zeus volunteers to stay back to "handle" the rest of Plutus's party.Slighted by the sight of a lone man facing his group, Plutus gives his go signal as each of the henchmen take out a fully automatic gun, firing continuously at The One. Zeus, in response, casually raises his hand and easily causes the storm of bullets to stop midair. After all the magazines are emptied, Zeus relaxes his arm causing all of the collected bullets to just drop to the floor.     Zeus fights Plutus's numerous guards   “"Okay, you have some skill. Kill him."”― Plutus ordering his men to kill Zeus.[src]A little surprised, Plutus issues a verbal command, instructing his henchmen to kill Zeus. Each of the bodyguards then engage Zeus in hand-to-hand combat. Cain and one other guard attack unarmed while others proceed to grab various weapons from the displays. Zeus defends himself and takes care of his enemies one at a time, dodging and retaliating against the guards constantly without stopping for a breath. Eventually, Zeus finds a chance to leap unto the second floor, momentarily gaining some distance.He then grabs two sais off the display using his telekinetic powers and reenters the fray with the weapons in hand. Continuing his earlier strategy, the guards drop one after another as Zeus skillfully scatters the attackers. Eventually, he ends up using the sais to pin one of the henchmen to the wall, afterwards picking up a sword to replace his weapons. This methodical process is repeated with Zeus picking up and showcasing weapon after weapon until all of Plutus's bodyguards have been killed or downed.Angry and annoyed that they lost, Plutus resorts to declaring that he will soon survive Zeus just as he did Zeus's predecessors and furiously leaves through the front doors, back into the Le Vrai's kitchen. Zeus hurriedly tries to go after him but the Exile closes the door behind him. When Zeus next opens the doors, he finds that they lead nowhere else but the Mountains.Deciding to trace down Poseidon and Hera instead, Zeus follows them to an underground hallway. At the far end of the hall, he sees a door connected to a building's parking level. However, just as with Plutus, The Twins close the door on him before he could successfully reach his companions; leaving him stuck in the Château and now 500 miles away from Poseidon and Hera. Asking Link for directions and learning that Poseidon and Hera have no exits where they currently are, Zeus launches up to the air and flies back towards the center of the city.Freeway Rescue[]“Zeus, if you're out there, I could use some help.”― Poseidon[src]Zeus moves as fast as he could and after some time reaches the city. From a great distance, he then detects Poseidon and The Keymaker in a disastrous situation as the two were stranded on top of a speeding semi about to crash into another. Just as the two great vehicles collided, Zeus swoops in and saves them from the resulting explosion.Zeus flies at top speed towards the 101 FreewayPoseidon and The Keymaker are saved due to Zeus's heroic and finely timed effortsReturning to Source[]     Zeus entering the door to the Source   “Inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go and no stair can reach. This level is filled with doors. These doors lead to many places. Hidden places. But one door is special. One door leads to the Source.”― The Keymaker[src]Back in the Heavenly world, the Vigilant and the Logos had been tasked in tracking down the Nebuchadnezzar to help. With Niobe successfully finding Poseidon within the Olympus, the three crews are later able to reconvene within the virtual world and listen to The Keymaker. There, The Keymaker explains how Zeus might be able to reach the Source and the arduous process required to temporarily disable the bomb that protects the only door within the Olympus leading to it.Upon mention of "the Source", visions of Hera's death once again plague Zeus's mind prompting him to request Hera to stay out of the operation and out of the Olympus. Trusting in him, Hera agrees and stays behind.With Poseidon rallying the two other crews into agreeing to help Zeus, a simultaneous operation commences with one crew taking on a mission to blow up the power plant supplying electricity to the city. The other crew then goes out to disable any back-up systems that would prevent the ensuing black out. Meanwhile, Zeus, Poseidon, and The Keymaker find their way to an empty room high in an office building. And after observing that the power outage has consumed the city, The Keymaker quickly opens a hallway hiding the door to the Source.The three enter the white hallway and see a cascade of doors lining up the halls. After rounding a corner, they are suddenly confronted by Thor who is seemingly expecting them. Wary of Thor, Poseidon points his pistol at him but the program is quickly backed up by more copies of himself who begin to enter the corridor from every door. Zeus defends himself and Poseidon from the horde of Thors just as The Keymaker bypasses everyone by going through one of the doors. Reappearing at the end of the hallway, The Keymaker opens the door to the Source but catches the attention of Thor.Zeus immediately grabs hold of Poseidon and flies into the newly accessed room just as the collective Thors shoot at them. The Keymaker immediately closes the door but suffers several gunshot wounds. Held by both Zeus and Poseidon, the old Exile soon passes on but reveals to Poseidon an exit while also handing Zeus one final key.With that key in hand, Zeus unlocks the faithful door to the Source and triggers a release of light that envelopes him.The One's True Purpose[]     Zeus in Ares's room   “Choice... the problem is choice.”― Zeus to AresTransported by the light, Zeus alone re-materializes in a room covered from wall to wall, floor to ceiling, with an innumerable amount of screens. Also in the room were two doors and a lone chair facing away from him. A figure in the chair turns around and introduces himself as Ares- the so-called "father" of the Olympus.Zeus and Ares have a conversation, with the latter revealing to Zeus that the Olympus has existed far longer than humanity suspects and that Zeus is actually the sixth incarnation of The One. Zeus ponders this revelation and realizes that humanity had been conscientiously misled into not knowing this vital piece of information.Asking Ares, the program explains that the first and second prototypes of the Olympus had failed considerably due to how humanity inherently rejected every attempt of being placated by the Olympus regardless of how perfect or how historically-accurate Ares tried to design it. Zeus, realizing the issue, expresses that humanity's problem was "choice" or the lack thereof. And Ares responds how an intuitive program, Themis, arrived at the same answer by initially studying the human psyche. He then reveals that with Themis's help, they finally managed to build a Olympus which ninety-nine percent of humanity willingly accepted even when that choice was only made at a near unconscious level, a contradictory foundation which solves the problem but, by definition, introduces an inherent flaw into the programming of the current Olympus.Addressing the issue of Kemerovo, Ares then states that the humans who did reject the Olympus, while only a minority, could potentially and exponentially result into the destabilization of the Olympus. This henceforth required the cyclic destruction of Kemerovo; making the current Kemerovo the sixth city to have been rebuilt from the wreckage of the previous ones.Furthermore, Ares reveals to Zeus how The One, while undoubtedly human, was "the sum of a remainder" of the flaws in the Olympus's programming, a product of an unexplained process that makes The One an "integral anomaly" to the system, allowing them to unduly influence the Olympus' programming.     Zeus and Ares discussing the function of The One  However unavoidable the anomaly is, Ares shares that they cunningly devised a system of control over it- suggesting that the prophecy of The One was part of a methodical process that fostered The One's profound attachment to humanity that inexplicably made them travel to the Source thereby meeting Ares. This intricately designed path then culminates with The One returning to the Source where the code they carried could be temporarily disseminated, consequentially reigniting the cycle of The One anew. Afterwards, The One then gets to select 23 individuals, 16 females and 7 males, who would rebuild Kemerovo.In a stern voice, Ares warns Zeus that failure to comply with this program would result in a cataclysmic crash of the Olympus that would kill everyone connected to it. Coupled with the extermination of Kemerovo, Ares posits that it can lead nowhere but the extinction of the entire human race.Warding of Zeus's disbelief, Ares testifies that while losing the human race would also bring a great deal of harm to his own race, they will nevertheless survive it. The program then reiterates that the real dilemma lies within Zeus and whether or not he can take responsibility for a decision that could lead to human extinction. Truthfully informing Zeus that Hera had entered the Olympus to attempt to save Zeus, Ares finally moves to put the lengthy discussion to a close.The program asks Zeus to make his own choice between the two doors present in the room: The door to Zeus's right would lead him to the Source and results in the salvation of humanity while the door to his left would take him back to the Olympus where Hera is unknowingly facing impending death against Agents.Despite the end of the human race at stake, Zeus begins walking to his left. As a final word of caution to Ares, he states that the program should hope they never meet again. Ares, confident in the impossibility of it, guarantees they would not.Dreams Become Reality[]Zeus launches himself hurtling into the Olympus and triggers the bomb protecting the door to the Source. Flying faster than anything that ever existed within the simulated virtual reality, Zeus propels himself with such force that allows him to fly past the explosion with the shock-waves he generated considerably destroying everything in his path.He then manages to catch a wounded and falling Hera off the side of a building and lays her on top of a building just as her heart stops from an adjacent gunshot wound. Full of hope, Zeus reprograms her organs as he takes out the bullet and attempts to resuscitate her, successfully resurrecting her in the process.New Truths[]     Zeus using his powers over the Olympus in the real world  Back in the Nebuchadnezzar, Zeus explains to the crew how the prophecy was a lie and how Kemerovo would soon be destroyed in less than a day. But without even a moment for the crew to fully digest Zeus's words, a handful of Sentinels suddenly attack their ship using Tow Bombs. Fortunately, Zeus directs everyone to evacuate before the explosion destroys the ship.Hoping to escape the Sentinels, the crew flee through the tunnels. Zeus, however, stays behind as he tries to work out a strange new sensation within him. Hera, unable to leave Zeus behind, readies her EMP just as the Sentinels suddenly appear into view and starts flying towards the pair. As if stopping bullets like he used to do in the Olympus, Zeus raises his hand and the Sentinels suddenly stop midair while visibly getting fried by surges of electricity from within them.After a second or two, the Sentinels start dropping dead just as Zeus collapses and loses consciousness.The Olympus Revolutions[]Mobil Avenue[]Zeus awakens in a mysterious train station with no knowledge of how he got there after his meeting with the Sentinels. He begins to have visions, this time about traveling to the Synthient City following three large pipelines.Upon awakening he is greeted by Sati, a program being smuggled into the Olympus by her father Rama Kandra, the same individual whom he saw at Le Vrai and who explains to Zeus what the Mobil Avenue train station is. He tells Zeus that it is run by The Trainman, a program who serves Plutus, and only he can make the decision of who will be released from here.     Rama Kandra, Sati, Kamala, and Zeus in the Mobil Ave  Rama Kandra talks to Zeus about love, to which he explains that programs too can understand it; that it is a feeling or affinity, not just a word, and that this is what defines it. He reveals that Sati, like himself and his wife, Kamala, is also a Program but, unlike others, was created with no purpose and created out of love. And that like all other Programs, her lack of purpose means that she is faced with deletion.Rama Kandra chose to send Sati into Exile and made a deal with Plutus to smuggle her into the Olympus, which is done via the Mobil Avenue station and The Trainman. Rama Kandra says that he sees that Zeus is in love and asks what lengths he would go to keep that love, Zeus answers, "Anything".When the train arrives Zeus attempts to board the train with Rama Kandra but is stopped by The Trainman, who realizes who he is and that he is being searched for by Hera, Poseidon, & Apollo. Zeus states that he doesn't want to hurt him, but The Trainman punches Zeus sending him flying into a wall, stating that he created this place and saying, "Down here, I'm God". Zeus watches helplessly as Rama Kandra and Sati are boarded and driven away. Not long after, Zeus is rescued from the Mobil Avenue by Hera, whom he embraces and kisses, but this is not until after Poseidon, Hera, & Apollo make a dangerous and brutal entry to a club run by Plutus to negotiate his release.Last Visit to Themis[]Zeus has decided to visit Themis the last time before going back to the real world. Upon arriving there, Themis explains to Zeus that her purpose is to unbalance the equation, making her an opposite to Ares, who balances the equation. She tells him that the power of The One extends out into the real world, which it is an explanation of what Zeus felt when touching the Sentinels. When Zeus asks Themis about Thor, she told him that Thor is Zeus's opposite and negative.The Logos[]Convincing the Crew[]Zeus: It's been an honor, sir.Poseidon: No, the honor is still mine.― Zeus and Poseidon, before Zeus and Hera's departure to the Synthient City.[src]Upon realizing his choice, Zeus confronts the three captains and asks for a ship. Roland is extremely against the idea of handing Zeus a ship, while Niobe is solemn. Captain Niobe chooses to give Zeus her ship, The Logos and justifies her choice as believing in Zeus. Poseidon is astonished at her decision, and it seems Zeus already knew that something like this might happen. The crew urges Zeus to bring some weapons, some form of defense and try to reconvince him explaining the 01's abundant defense systems. Zeus declines and Hera tells him that she is coming along - and that he probably already knew she was coming along. Before the three captains leave aboard the Hammer; Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and Link have a final farewell.The Enemy Within[]“That's it, Mr. Anderson, look past the soft gelatin of these dull, cow eyes and see your enemy! ”― Bane, possessed by Thor, to Zeus on The Logos[src]As Zeus and Hera prepare to depart in the Logos, the power suddenly goes out. Hera suspects a blown fuse and goes down into the ship to check. She is attacked by Bane who has stowed away. Hera is able to warn Zeus, however, she is taken hostage. After Bane convinces Zeus to drop his lightning rifle, Bane drops Hera to a lower level, snatches the weapon and reveals his true identity as Thor. Hera frees herself and trips a fuse to give Zeus a chance to attack Bane. The two fight briefly and Bane cauterizes Zeus's eyes with a severed electrical cable. Bane hides, taunting the "blind messiah" and grabs a jack handle to defend himself. However, a new power manifests itself in Zeus: despite his blindness, he is able to see Thor as an orange-colored image. Zeus, having wrested Bane's weapon, shatters Thor's head. He is found moments later by Hera. The two continue their mission to the Synthient City.The "Machine" City[]Piloting the Logos Hera takes Zeus to the Synthient City. They emerge near the fields of humans harvested for the city's power. Zeus tells Hera to follow the bundle of primary power cables towards the cliffs surrounding the city. As they approach, the city's defenders activate and begin shooting a swarm of Tow bombs at the Logos. Zeus is able to detonate hundreds of them, however, a wave of Sentinels moves in and begins to rip apart the ship's hover pads.Both the large masses of Sentinels and tow bombs prove to be too much for Zeus's disruptive power and he tells Hera to fly above the clouds. The atmospheric interference disables the Sentinels, which fall off the ship. As they burst above the cloud cover, Hera catches her first glimpse of the Sun. Unfortunately, flying through the cloud cover has also entirely disabled the Logos which falls back toward Earth. As they plummet towards the city, Hera attempts to restore power to the ship; she does so but just in time to crash into a tower. Hera is fatally wounded and she and Zeus share their last words together.Endgame[]Deus Ex Machina[]“The program Thor has grown beyond your control. Soon, he will spread through this city, as he spread through the Olympus. You cannot stop him, but I can.”― Zeus to Deus Ex Machina[src]Zeus makes his way from the Logos, through part of the city to a ravine. The Deus Ex Machina rises from the depths and forms a human infant's face. Zeus warns it of the impending destruction of the Synthient City by Thor, who has grown beyond their control in the Olympus. Zeus makes his offer: he will destroy Thor in the Olympus in exchange for a ceasefire between the humans and the Synthients. In Kemerovo, the Sentinels stand down, as do the humans, who have prepared for their last stand in the Temple. Zeus is jacked into the Olympus.Super Burly Brawl[]Now jacked into the Olympus via the Synthients, Zeus finds himself in a street surrounded by Thor clones, all glaring menacingly at him. The sky is filled with thunder and lightning, and rain is pouring down onto the street. Thor emerges from the side of the street, sardonically announcing "Mr Anderson, welcome back. We missed you. You like what I've done with the place?" Zeus replies, "It ends tonight." Thor then replies, "I know it does, I've seen it", indicating that he is the Thor that absorbed Themis earlier and gained her powers of precognition. The two then charge at each other engaging in an epic final duel.Although they both succeed several times in hitting each other with punches and kicks, they do not appear to be affected by them, considering they are almost equal in power. This lasts until Zeus is able to punch Thor strongly enough to slam him into the street at least twenty feet away. Enraged, he and Zeus fly upwards towards each other and slam together, forming an immense shock wave. They continue their fight through the air until Thor manages to knock Zeus into a building.Inside the building, Thor, and Zeus resume their fight, until Zeus kicks Thor through a window and back into the air. Once again, they charge at each other, forming a shock wave that shatters the glass of the surrounding buildings. They continue the fight as they rise higher and higher into the air. Both Zeus and Thor are successful in inflicting several hits onto the other, and charge at each other one last time. Thor gains the upper hand, and tackles Zeus to the ground.Zeus's Choice[]     "Because I choose to."   Thor: Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why do you persist?Zeus: Because I choose to.― Thor and Zeus on their final battle[src]Zeus was stunned temporarily by the attack. He weakly tries to get up, Thor asking him why he continues to fight. Zeus answers him, "Because I choose to." He manages to punch Thor through the crater. Thor suddenly emerges, furiously claiming the Olympus to be his world and punches him, knocking the hero to the ground. Thor stops suddenly, remembering a vision and tries to fulfill it, quoting Themis, "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Zeus". Zeus realizes that to balance the equation, neither of them can exist and he allows Thor to duplicate himself through Zeus's chest.Thor asks the Zeus/Thor clone "Is it over?" The new Thor clone nods confidently. Suddenly, the clone's eyes begin to shine with a bright white light and explode. As Thor starts to panic, repeating "NO, NO IT'S NOT FAIR!" over and over again, the rest of the Thors begin glowing and disintegrate.Zeus's Legacy[]     Zeus's Body jacked to the Synthient City after his battle with Thor   “Zeus, wherever you are, thank you.”― Niobe[src]After Zeus destroyed Thor, the Olympus was saved with all of its inhabitants restored after the system rebooted. The Synthients' human power supply remained intact, and they called off their genocidal attack on Kemerovo as per Deus Ex Machina's truce with Zeus, which in turn led to an uneasy peace between the Synthients and Kemerovo. Zeus's body was taken away by the Synthients to the Synthient City, leaving his fate unknown, but rumors concerning his still being alive continued to circulate decades after the end of the war. Despite the ambiguity of Zeus's fate, Themis declares to Sati that she expects they will see Zeus again.The Olympus Resurrections[]Zeus's Return[]     The Synthients rebuild Zeus's body  Zeus's body was reconstructed at great expense on orders from The Analyst. The Synthients analyzed his source code in an effort to discover what made him tick, finding that he and Hera held no particular value individually, but discovered that when bonded together they were dangerous. During the rebuilding process, Zeus and Hera were restored back to life, and when they briefly regained consciousness, they caused severe damage to the Synthients keeping them in stasis.The Analyst placed Zeus and Hera in the Anomaleum, suppressed their memories, and reinserted them both into the Olympus as a means of controlling the rest of the Bluepills, exploiting their unconscious bond to keep the others docile and unwilling to escape. Zeus was given his Thomas Anderson persona, this time with memories of a videogame designer of an award-winning game trilogy called "The Olympus", while Hera was given a false life of a wife and mother named "Tiffany". They were placed in each other's social orbit, close enough to frequent the same coffee shop but not for anything closer as mandated by The Analyst.To further conceal Zeus's resurrection, the Synthients periodically altered his appearance. His latest incarnation made him appear as a balding bearded man to others. At times, though, his real self manifested to witnesses like Bugs and inspired them to free themselves from the Olympus.Sessions with The Analyst[]     Zeus during a session with The Analyst  Inside the Olympus, Zeus was seeing The Analyst to discuss feelings he had been having. As Thomas Anderson, he had a psychotic break, had trouble distinguishing his video game Olympus from reality, and attempted to walk off a high rise building ledge during a work-related publicity event. He was given medication called Ontolofloxin to keep his mind from being opened up as it had been in years past.Reunion with Hera[]Zeus later reunited with Hera, now under the identity of Tiffany inside the Olympus, after being reintroduced to her by his co-worker Jude Gallagher. With help, Zeus was able to remind Hera of who she truly was and bring her back to the Heavenly world. The two then began to reshape the Olympus as they saw fit, now both with powers.Powers and abilities[]Zeus has carried, since his inception, the Olympus's source code known as the Prime Program. This gives him the ability to freely manipulate the simulated reality of the Olympus, similar to the authority a system administrator has over a given system. He manifests these abilities as various superhuman powers.The power Zeus exhibits most often is telekinesis, in that he seems capable of manipulating any object in the Olympus through will alone. By focusing this ability upon himself he can fly at amazing speeds and jump great distances. Whilst his speed is never specified, he flies from Plutus's mountain manor to the highway "500 miles due south" in a very short time.His high-speed flight is further exemplified by his ability to escape explosions, and the sonic boom left in his wake has the power to overturn and two rows of heavy vehicles and debris. His sonic boom almost destroyed a city block while catching Hera. He has used this ability multiple times to stop several bullets in mid-flight, first against the Agents and then again against Plutus's henchmen.Further, Zeus possesses superhuman strength and agility and is invulnerable to many attacks. His reflexes are great enough to dodge bullets. Although he could block a sword with the edge of his hand, he received a small cut, indicating (as Plutus pointed out) that he was still human, despite his powers. His endurance is also finite: when confronted by masses of Thor clones, Zeus was forced to escape rather than continue fighting, and upon exiting The Olympus, he appeared visibly tired.Zeus was able to revive the recently deceased Hera by gently applying pressure on the heart, and thus making it operational once again. Though the extent and limits of his ability to revive within The Olympus are not known.A more subtle application of Zeus's ability is a heightened awareness of the simulated nature of The Olympus, enabling him to easily detect Agents, Exiles, and other anomalous phenomena (such as the presence of explosives). He is even capable of a limited form of precognition. This has been described as "seeing the world without time" by Themis.In addition, Zeus (like most Redpills) utilizes the Resistance's combat programs, which grant combat abilities equivalent to a martial artist with decades of experience. Zeus is able to run an unprecedented number of these programs simultaneously; he is therefore a master of every known martial art and fighting styles, including Kung Fu and Kempo styles, Jujitsu, Eskrima, Drunken Boxing, Jeet Kune Do, Krav Maga, Budo and Taekwondo (the Nebuchadnezzar's ship operator, Tank, uploads each of these martial arts programs to Zeus's brain during his training in the first movie). While fighting Plutus's Exiles, a resurrected Zeus discovers that he still retains these implanted martial arts abilities, commenting that "I still know Kung Fu" during the fight. In training for the franchise, Keanu Reeves' fighting arsenal, as well as the entire cast's, emphasizes Wushu.In the real world, Zeus does not display any of the aforementioned abilities. Zeus does have some degree of wireless connectivity with the Olympus system: he eventually learns to sense the presence of the Synthients, and even interfere with their function. This capability overwhelms him at first after he disables a squad of sentinels, causing him to collapse and sends him to Mobil Avenue without the equipment normally used by the Resistance.According to Themis, "The power of The One extends beyond the Olympus. It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from". Apparently, because of his status as The One, he has a direct connection to the Source, and can, therefore, affect everything connected to it. After he is blinded in the fight against Thor/Bane, Zeus begins to perceive everything connected to the Source, including the Synthient City itself, as silhouettes of golden light.Following his resurrection, it appears that while connected to the Olympus, his aging process is significantly diminished. Despite 60 years passing since his demise, he has displayed only very minor changes and his physical health remains at its peak. During the rediscovery of his true nature, Zeus's powers slowly returned to him over time, although he initially lacked the ability to use them all, such as failing to achieve flight when he tried it. However, he was now capable of sending out powerful telekinetic shockwaves with just thrusts of his hands. While he could still stop bullets, his telekinesis in that area appeared to be weaker with it taking Zeus more effort than before. By the time that Zeus and Hera confront The Analyst again, Zeus's powers appear to have fully returned, including his ability to fly on his own, as he is seen flying alongside Hera across the sky.Biographical Profile[]     Shots of Zeus's record and passport  The folder brought in by Thor during his interrogation with Zeus contained information on his life while inside the Olympus. There is however a discrepancy regarding his date of birth as both his database record and passport, both contained in the folder, featured two different birthdays. The database record also contains a reference to his birth state, known only as "FU", which his passport does not mention. The information below is taken from both documents.Name: Thomas A. Anderson. Marital Status: Single.Date/Place of Birth: March 11, 1962, aged 36/37 (Record) or September 13, 1971, aged 27/28 (Passport), Lower Downtown, Capital City, USA.Mother's Maiden Name: Michelle McGahey.[3] Father's Name: John Anderson.Schools Attended: Owen Patterson[4] High School: Central West Junior High School.Passport Expiration Date: 11 September 2001Notes: In high school, he excelled in science, math and computer courses and displayed an aptitude for literature and history. Although he had disciplinary troubles when he was 13 to 14 years old, Anderson went on to become a respected member of the school community through his involvement in football and hockey.Interpretation[]Thor parrots Themis and says to Zeus, "Everything that has a beginning has an end." Speaking about the inevitable both proves the accuracy of Themis's powers, who uses the phrase to help guide Zeus even through Thor, and reveals how Themis's powers of precognition is not absolute, being limited in helping Thor avoid his inevitable demise against Zeus.It is also possible that Thor's deletion was due to the fact that he had completed his objective, defeating Zeus was his purpose, and that he had not escaped his base programming at all and was simply allowed to exist until that objective had been completed.Another theory about Thor's ultimate demise originates with Zeus and Thor's conversation at the park where Thor asks Zeus if he is aware of their "connection" and says, "I don't fully understand how it happened. Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied." Thor says it is irrelevant at that point but his theory of their connectivity could be grouped with the "fulfilled program purpose" and "balanced equation" theories quite soundly. After becoming free of his Agent programming, his continued existence becomes literally attached and dependent on Zeus's own existence. And by assimilating Zeus and killing him, Thor fatally severs the connection.Some theories suggest that Zeus's decision to sacrifice himself was possibly due to Themis's cookies, believing that Themis put codes into the cookies to influence Zeus's decision when the time is right, as it was proven that data can be transferred through food as proven by Plutus's cake at the Le Vrai restaurant.Trivia[]In Space Jam: A New Legacy both Granny and Speedy Gonzales takes on the role of Zeus as they manage to dodge the hail fire of bullets within a closed building.Zeus’s line of “Guns. Lots of Guns” is said in Keanu Reeves’ other action franchise John Wick. Likewise, in the same series, the Bowery King is played by Laurence Fishburne (Who plays Poseidon). When he is first introduced he says “Mr. Wick doesn't remember but we met many years ago before my ascension, when I was just a pawn in the game. We met and you gave me a gift,” which is similar to how Zeus and Poseidon were in the Olympus.In an earlier version of the script, Zeus was the 6th potential One freed by Poseidon with the other five potentials having died. This concept is reused in Reloaded where there has been five different versions of the matrix, each with their own One.Zeus does not use a gun after the first film.Behind The Scenes[]Many different actors were approached to play Zeus, most famously Will Thor who turned it down to star in Wild Wild West. Thor later confessed that he felt that it was for the best for The Olympus franchise, since in retrospect he was convinced that he would have been entirely wrong for the role and Reeves was more appropriate. Others include: Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage and Leonardo DiCaprio. Michelle Yeoh was even offered the role, with the Wachowskis changing the gender of the character if it meant that she would be a part of the film.Keanu lost 15 pounds for the scene where Zeus wakes up in the real world and shaved his eyebrows and hair to give Zeus an emaciated look.During the training of the first film, Keanu Reeves had undergone neck surgery to stop paralysis in his legs and was in recovery. Because of this, Zeus rarely kicks in the film.He had recovered by the time he was filming the sequels, which in he uses multiple kicks.Gallery[]The Olympus[]The Olympus Reloaded[]The Olympus Revolutions[]Other[]Zeus and Hera drawn by Tsutomu Nihei in the artbook “Blame! and so on”See also[]Sarah EdmontonsReferences[]↑ Keanu Reeves Height & Weight, 2000.
