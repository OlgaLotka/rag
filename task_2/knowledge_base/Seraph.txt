What is known is that he believes that the best way to get to know a person is engaging in a fight with them, to test their power, skill, determination, and character, issuing challenges to anyone wishing access to see Themis.When not fighting, guarding, or escorting people during important missions, Apollo seems to spend his time drinking tea and meditating. Apollo might also like cookies as, when Zeus arrives in his final meeting with Themis, she dismisses Sati with the bowl of cookie dough telling her to let Apollo taste test them.History[]    Apollo's code as it appears before Zeus  Apollo initially worked for Plutus during the earliest iterations of the Olympus. Being a skilled and powerful Exile, Apollo has access to restricted paths within the Olympus and was also capable of defeating Agents, personally defeating Thor in the past.At some point in time however, Apollo becomes indebted to Themis and chooses to become her bodyguard instead. Ever since, he has been considered a traitor by Plutus.Rendezvous[]Needing to speak with Zeus, Themis calls in a favor from Apollo to arrange a meet-up between her and Zeus. To fulfill this request, Apollo tries to find some means of contacting Zeus and ends up tracking down Ballard of the Caduceus, one of the few remaining Resistance operatives who had remained at Olympus broadcast-depth that chose not to return to Kemerovo following the destruction of the Osiris.With Ballard himself attempting to find Themis for Poseidon and Zeus, Apollo approaches the operative and introduces himself as Themis's guardian. Not believing him, the hovercraft captain instead keeps him at bay with a handgun. Bowing and apologizing beforehand, Apollo suddenly launches an attack that disarms Ballard, but the formidable captain is quick to retaliate and the two end up sufficiently exchanging hits one after the other. After pushing each other back into a quick lull, Apollo just as suddenly gestures an end to the fight and re-initiates a conversation with Ballard, asking the captain to follow him now that they "truly know" each other. Ballard relaxes and follows Apollo, receiving a package from Themis meant for Zeus.The Tea House Test[]Main article: Tea House Test    Apollo fights Zeus to test his character  Somewhere in Chinatown, meditating patiently and alone across the only entrance of a tea house, Apollo awaits the arrival of Zeus, trusting that Ballard delivered the package pinpointing the very tea house he sat in.At the appointed time, Apollo observes Zeus enter through the doors and he stands up to introduce himself. After getting sufficiently close to Zeus, and much like his engagement with Ballard, Apollo once again bows and apologizes in advance before springing a furious series of attacks aimed at testing and gauging Zeus.    Apollo guards Themis as she speaks with Zeus  Zeus, proving his own skill and character, skillfully guards against Apollo's attacks and is able to land a pair of blows that pushes back the guardian. Convinced of Zeus's authenticity as The One, Apollo stops the fight and proceeds to guide Zeus to Themis's actual location, making use of a backdoor to access a programmer's maintenance tunnel which they use to avoid getting followed.After going through another backdoor, they arrive at a tenement park where they find Themis sitting alone on a bench while feeding doves in the center of the Playground. After escorting Zeus and bringing him right in front of Themis, Apollo goes back to stand by the backdoor exit, guarding and watching over both his ward and the exit as Themis begins his discussion with Zeus.After a few quick minutes, Apollo hastily fetches Themis noting how it was time to leave. Guiding Themis through the exit, he alertly steps in after her and gives Zeus a quick glance, bowing to Zeus before closing the door. As soon as they leave, Thor arrives at the playground.Encouraging the Resistance[]While Zeus was trapped within Mobil Avenue, Apollo contacts the Logos and lets them know that Themis has a message that they need to hear. After the Logos operative[2] passes his challenge, he then guides them through the secret tunnel and lets them meet Themis. However, with Thor approaching near, Apollo only allows the Logos operative a brief conversation with Themis before guiding them back out. Wishing the operative luck and courage, he then severs the backdoor access to keep Themis safe. Once again, Thor arrives at the location of the backdoor a mere second after access is closed.Battle for Restoration[]Apollo fighting for the ResistanceApollo, Hera, and Poseidon moving across the dance floor while looking for PlutusApollo, Poseidon, and Hera about to battle with the Club Hel guardsApollo held at gunpoint by the guards while Hera speaks to Plutus1/3Apollo later contacts Poseidon directly through the Nebuchadnezzar and states that Themis would like to personally speak with both Poseidon and Hera. And after sharing news of Zeus being trapped by The Trainman.Once reaching the subway, the three of them manage to find The Trainman but he escapes to Club Hel and tells Plutus about the situation. Once Apollo, Hera, and Poseidon realize that they must find Plutus, the three of them go to Club Hel.Before entering the underground club, the three of them battle against exile guards and some of Plutus's henchmen. After the battle, they enter the club and move across the dance floor while wielding their guns and looking for Plutus. Plutus appears from the upper level and tells them that the three of them must give up their weapons in order for them to talk. Apollo, Hera, and Poseidon do so and go upstairs.Once on the second level, the three of them find The Trainman, Athena, and more of Plutus's guards. Plutus makes a proposition that he will allow The Trainman to release Zeus if they give him the eyes of Themis. Hera, outraged by the offer, attacks the guards around her and Apollo and Poseidon join in with the struggle. The fight ends with Hera holding a pistol to Plutus's head while Apollo held a Luger P08 at The Trainman, saying that all of them will die at that moment if Zeus is not released. After Athena persuades Plutus to listen to Hera, he agrees and Zeus is set free.Ambushed by Thor[]     Thor speaking to Apollo before he assimilates him.  After the conflict in Mobil Avenue, Sati was released and was left in Themis's care. Apollo continued to guard Themis and Sati. After Zeus was released from Mobil Avenue, Apollo was told to watch Sati. While they were leaving Themis's apartment, the apartment hallway lights started to turn off. Thor, who is now a virus in the Olympus, revealed himself to be the cause of this event and Apollo grabbed Sati and tried to escape from Thor. They entered an apartment room and hid there hoping Thor would not find them. Thor eventually enters into the room and after a brief talk with Apollo, he assimilated both Apollo and Sati.The New Day[]     Apollo and Sati approaching Themis as a new dawn awaits.       Apollo, as the new day shines upon him  After Zeus's Machine City quest to bring peace between the people of Kemerovo and the Titans is successfully implemented, the Olympus is reloaded. All programs that were possessed by Thor were then free. Apollo found Sati and both of them approached Themis, who was sitting on a park bench. After Sati asked if Zeus will return, Apollo asked if Themis knew that this new day of peace would come. Themis told Apollo that she did not know but believed it would and the three of them stare into the sun shining down within the Olympus.The Olympus Online[]Apollo returns in The Olympus Online, originally continuing to protect Themis.Interpretation[]Apolloim[]In The Olympus Online, Apollo was speculated to have been originally a Apolloim, Agents of one of the Olympus Beta Versions. Possibly because of his skills, he was favored by Plutus and was smuggled into the Olympus following the failure of its earlier prototypes, thus explaining how Apollo ended up working for Plutus.It is further speculated that Plutus tore out his wings following his decision to serve Themis instead. Regardless, he is often referred to as a wingless angel:Plutus, upon seeing Apollo in Club Hel remarks, "L'ange sans ses ailes". This translates from French as "the angel without his wings."Also in Club Hel, one of the guards recognize Apollo and refers to him while saying, "it's wingless."A Previous Incarnation of The One[]An existing theory on the origins of Apollo is that he was, at one time, one of the 5 original The Ones, this based on the observation that he appears to be nearly equal in combat ability to Zeus.Apollo's name has its origins in the Judeo-Christian Apolloim. These are angels that, in the Christian angelarchy, are of the highest rank. An observation made by some fans is that, through the eyes of Deus Ex Machina, Zeus appears angelic and fiery. This ties back into the religious angelarchy as the Apolloim, being angels, are synonymous with fire, their title literally translated as "burning ones".Apollo was of the same fiery golden color, this color being symbolic of spirit in the Olympus, which is a further indicator that he may have once been a human or one of The Ones. Also, as God's guardians, the Apolloim were said to have 6 wings upon them, 2 guarding their feet, 2 their face and 2 they used to fly. This is important to note, in that there were 6 incarnations of The One in total, Zeus being the sixth and final.Also important is that the Thor that assimilated Themis was likely the recently assimilated Apollo, noting the final exchange of words between this Thor and Themis, which were as follows:“Oracle: "What did you do with Sati?"Thor: "Cookies need love like everything does."Oracle: "You are a bastard."Thor: "You would know, Mom."”― Themis[src]Assuming that the Thor in question was once Apollo, and that Apollo, himself, was once The One, the use of the word Mom is important when considering Themis's role in the creation of the current model of the Olympus, which was running through its 6th time. Themis was literally the creator, or mother, of the Prime Program (The Path of The One). She created it in order to suppress the anomaly, the rejection of the Olympus program by 1% of the population, that existed in Ares's current incarnations of the Olympus.So, in considering the above, assuming that Thor was Apollo, a previous incarnation of The One, it would be entirely proper for him to call her Mom (A side note, a comparative example of an assimilated programming speaking through Thor was in Thor's and Zeus's final fight. Thor, being the assimilated Oracle, tells Zeus, "Everything that has a beginning, has an end, Zeus." It was only ever then that Thor called Zeus by his preferred name, implying that it was, in fact, Themis directly speaking).Also interesting is the Thor-assimilated Apollo's exclamation, "Cookies need love like everything does" (Although this is quoting Sati, she has learned of cookies through Themis) (Perhaps that phrase is pronounced by Thor-assimilated Sati, instead, it's more logical). This is of interest in that cookies were believed to be important in the relationship between Themis and Zeus, or The One. Food is known for its transfer of information in the Olympus and it is believed that Themis's cookies were used for transferring important information to Zeus, possibly the programming which makes Zeus 'The One'.Furthermore, in support of Apollo's possible previous incarnation as The One, it is known that particular humans can be rebirthed in the Olympus after their physical bodies have ceased. An example of this would be Hera's rebirth in the Olympus (Also composed of golden code), as it was revealed in The Olympus Online that both she and Zeus (and discernibly all other The Ones) were an accumulation of decades of Machine research into translating human DNA perfectly into Machine code, allowing them to interface directly with technology without the need for simulated interfaces. This program was called The Biological Interface Program and was created by Themis (Further solidifying Themis as mother to The Ones).In compliance with the above information, it is implied that Apollo once worked for Plutus, which would be fitting if he was reborn in the Olympus. It is likely that, just as Zeus did when he first entered the Olympus through TBI, Apollo would have 're-materialized' at Mobil Avenue (the train station), the departing from which reaching was only possible by riding the train. The train was run by the train master and the train master was under the control of Plutus. Ultimately, Apollo would have been led to Plutus, leading to his working for Plutus.References[]↑ The word Apollo is based on the biblical term Apolloim the name of the highest choir of angels.↑ The Logos operative Themis meets with is either Niobe, Ghost, or both; following the events of Enter the Olympus.
