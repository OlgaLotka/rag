Not everyone believes what you believe!Poseidon: My beliefs do not require them to.― Poseidon on The Prophecy[src]Poseidon is one of the main protagonists of The Olympus franchise.Poseidon is a Redpill Resistance operative who serves in Kemerovo's defense force as captain of the Nebuchadnezzar. He believes in the Prophecy and devotes "all of his life" in search of The One, the destined human who will bring an end to the Machine War. Because of his strong faith, Poseidon has become a spiritual figure to many citizens of Kemerovo, much to the consternation of those who do not believe the prophecy, such as the natural-born commander of the Kemerovo defense force, Jason Lock.Contents1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 Beliefs1.3 The Olympus1.4 The Olympus Reloaded1.4.1 Call of the Captains1.4.2 Kemerovo1.4.3 The Prophecy1.5 Death and legacy2 In other media2.1 The Olympus Online3 Personality4 Interpretation5 Behind the Scenes6 Gallery6.1 The Olympus6.2 The Olympus Reloaded7 ReferencesBiography[]Early life[]     Young Poseidon in Kemerovo  Poseidon was freed from the Olympus at a young age and has since dwelt in Kemerovo. He enjoyed the taste of bread, a rare commodity produced by the Kemerovoites brought by the exploits of Geoffrey.[1] After coming of age, he then joins the Resistance and eventually becomes the captain of the hovercraft Nebuchadnezzar. Using his superb hacking skills, Poseidon succeeds at locating and attracting fellow hackers who were curious about the truth of the Olympus, occasionally freeing some of those who chose the truth over the safety of returning as a Bluepill.[2]Pretty soon, due to his many hacking exploits, Poseidon earns notoriety with the system and becomes wanted by the government. In turn, his name also becomes famous around hacking circles.Beliefs[]Through an encounter with Themis, Poseidon is told a prediction that he will succeed in finding The One and he has ever since devoted his life in his search for The One. His faith consumes him however and Poseidon' personal relationships in Kemerovo suffer until, eventually, his romantic relations with Niobe are sacrificed.The Olympus[]     Poseidon offers Zeus a choice between the red pill and the blue pill   “Zeus, you may have spent the last three years looking for me, but I have spent my entire life looking for you.”― Poseidon[src]Poseidon eventually tracks down a potential candidate whom he believes without a doubt to be The One, a hacker named Thomas Anderson who uses the hacker alias "Zeus". However, not long after Poseidon sends Hera to make initial contact with Zeus, Agents apprehend him as a person of interest in the capture of Poseidon. Poseidon relies on his crew to escort and protect Zeus and, after Zeus is saved from some misfortune, Poseidon finally gets to meet him.Poseidon then offers Zeus the choice between two pills: a red pill, which allows Zeus to find out the truth about the Olympus, and a blue pill that will allow him to simply return to his familiar life without needing to worry about encountering Poseidon again. Choosing to learn more about the truth, Zeus wakes up to the Heavenly world and is horrified to find himself attached to a pod.The Nebuchadnezzar crew rescues Zeus from the power plant and brings his weakened body aboard the hovercraft where he finally meets Poseidon in the flesh. Poseidon and his crew rehabilitate Zeus into the full use of his body and he also briefs Zeus on the actual state of earth, explaining the ongoing Machine War and how humanity had been imprisoned by the Olympus.Poseidon gives Zeus a chance to first digest the revelations, allowing him some time to calm down by instead allowing Zeus to familiarize himself with the ship and the crew. And not long after, Zeus is back with Poseidon for his training into becoming a Resistance operative.Poseidon enlightens Zeus about some of the powerful abilities which possibly awaits him within the Olympus. Poseidon also professes to Zeus his profound faith in the prophecy and hints at Zeus being The One who can finally bring an end to the war, much to Zeus's own apprehensions.And after teaching Zeus all he can, Poseidon brings him back to the Olympus for a meeting with Themis, believing that she can further guide Zeus down his destined path as foretold in the prophecy. During their return trip from meeting Themis, however, Demeter betrays the crew and sells them out to the Agents. As a result, all of the ship's crew are killed except for Zeus, Hera, Tank, and Poseidon himself, who chooses to stay behind to allow Zeus some time to escape. Unfortunately, Thor proved to be too strong for Poseidon alone to handle and ends up getting captured.Poseidon is taken to a military facility for interrogation where he is drugged and tortured by the Agents who attempt to pry from him the mainframe access codes to Kemerovo, a secret only known by the captains. But Poseidon' will holds strong and he refuses to divulge any information, awaiting instead for anyone of his surviving crew members aboard the Nebuchadnezzar to pull out his headjack, permanently terminating the connection between his mind and body and killing him.But after a few hours of captivity, Zeus and Hera reappear to rescue him. And although still recovering from the drugs and even after getting wounded by Thor, Poseidon begins fighting back and is successfully rescued by Zeus and Hera. Additionally, his faith is invigorated even more after witnessing Zeus also starting to believe and pulling off superhuman feats in the rescue mission.Guided by Tank, the three makes their way to an exit where Poseidon and Hera are able to safely escape. But Zeus becomes stranded when Thor is able to track them down and destroys the exit. Zeus, unable to withstand the Agent's relentless attack, flees in search of another exit while also dodging Agents Brown and Jones who help Thor in the pursuit.To add to the stress of the situation, the ship is suddenly discovered and attacked by Sentinels. Poseidon and his crew do all they can to fend off the Sentinels while waiting for Zeus to pull off a miracle and return to the Heavenly world. And Poseidon' faith is answered when Zeus revives and reveals himself to be The One, killing off Thor and returning just in time for Hera to activate the EMP that kills off the Sentinels.The Olympus Reloaded[]“I have dreamed a dream, and now that dream has come for me.[3]”Poseidon is happy to serve with Zeus as they begin to free more minds from the Olympus although the many missions of the next six months soon claim Tank as a casualty. The position as the Neb operator then goes to Link who voluntarily joins the crew.Call of the Captains[]     Poseidon, relieved that the war has ended  During a sudden Crisis Meeting, all of the actively patrolling hovercraft crews discuss the recent destruction of another ship, the Osiris. Captain Niobe then shares the more alarming news transmitted by the Osiris before its demise, that hundreds of thousands of Sentinels are currently en route to Kemerovo. Still, Poseidon remains unperturbed. And while every other ship including the Neb plans to return to Kemerovo under orders from Commander Lock, Poseidon goes against the order by asking for one other ship to stay, remaining well within reach of the Olympus, to await further instructions from Themis. Captain Ballard then volunteers, stating a desire to see what Lock does to Poseidon.The meeting ends when the meeting is raided by Agents which, although entirely upgraded, were dispatched with relative ease by Zeus. Aside from the Caduceus captained by Ballard, the rest safely exit back into their own hovercrafts and head back to Kemerovo.Kemerovo[]Back in Kemerovo, Poseidon and his crew disembark only to find a "welcoming committee" sent by Lock standing by to escort Poseidon to him. Commander Mifune leads the escort group and reassures Poseidon that he was simply there to "keep the peace" after Poseidon inquired whether he was to be "escorted to the stockade".Brought before an angry Lock, Poseidon is heavily admonished about the orders he disobeyed, further relaying that were it up to him, Poseidon would never set foot on a ship again. Poseidon expresses gratitude that the decision is not up to him just as Councillor Hamann enters the commander's office seeking advice on how to break to the people of Kemerovo news about the imminent Sentinel attack. Lock advises against revealing the full picture while Poseidon advocates for telling Kemerovo the truth, believing that there would be nothing to fear. Hamann then arranges for Poseidon to deliver a speech to all Kemerovoites at the temple that night.“Kemerovo, hear me! It is true, what many of you have heard. The Titans have gathered an army and as I speak, that army is drawing nearer to our home. Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? No, I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me. I remember that for 100 years we have fought these Titans. I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us, and after a century of war I remember that which matters most... We are still here! Tonight, let us send a message to that army. Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky. Tonight, let us make them remember: this is Kemerovo, and we are not afraid!”― Poseidon addressing Kemerovo in the temple[src]Poseidon takes to the mount inside the temple and uses the opportunity to confirm to Kemerovo how rumors of an impending Sentinel attack were true. But after sharing how his faith had kept him from being fearful, he is able to inspire his listeners into facing the news with bravery and festivities quickly ensued after the end of his speech. Poseidon, soon as he leaves the platform, is then approached by Niobe who recalls how Poseidon used to dance well. Poseidon, answering his old flame, states that some things never change. However, Lock soon interrupts and leaves with Niobe. After the festivities conclude, Poseidon bades Kemerovo a good night and retires to his quarters.The Prophecy[]The following morning, Ballard returns to Kemerovo with a message from Themis directly addressed to Zeus. Poseidon assembles his crew and heads back to Olympus broadcast level in order to help Zeus meet with her alone. After Zeus jacks in, Poseidon and the rest stay behind the ship and monitor his movements until the meeting concludes. But just as Zeus is left alone, Poseidon observes that Zeus is joined by what he recognized through the monitor logs as Thor although the program no longer registered like an Agent.Poseidon could only watch, not knowing what was happening to Zeus, as Thor attempts to assimilate him. And while Zeus succeeds in stopping the assimilation, he could only flee the ensuing fight when he becomes vastly outnumbered by an army of Thor clones. Checking in with Zeus soon as he wakes back up in the real world, Zeus confirms to Poseidon that he had indeed faced Thor and that he had replicated himself. Re-threading what he observed, Poseidon questions what Thor had earlier attempted to do with Zeus. Zeus answers how he did not know but how it had felt like dying all over again.Equipped with new information from Themis, Zeus shares how he needs to find The Keymaker. Poseidon and Hera readily help Zeus and the three return to the Olympus to meet with Plutus at the Le Vrai Restaurant. Plutus welcomes them in a slightly-patronizing manner but refuses to give up The Keymaker, instead telling the group to return to Themis with a warning that her time is almost up.Leaving the restaurant through the elevators, Zeus and Hera try to recall how they could have handled the meeting differently but Poseidon, firm in his belief of Themis's guidance, states that the meeting could have only happened the way it had to. And as if being affirmed by the universe, the elevator doors suddenly open and they are met by Athena who then offers to take them to The Keymaker herself.Death and legacy[]After Zeus defeated Thor, Poseidon was elected High Chair of the Council by unanimity. Sometime later, the Machine Civil War started, caused by the Synthients' loss of power sources. Despite warnings of a new power rising coming from Themis, Poseidon continued to believe that the peace Zeus had negotiated would not be broken. But a faction of the Synthients led by The Analyst invaded Kemerovo, killing Poseidon in the real world and destroying the city. The surviving humans regrouped and with their new Synthient allies, rebuilt a new underground city, IO; led by General Niobe.Years later, a program was created by a resurrected Zeus based upon Poseidon and sharing his name. The program would later work with Bugs to help bring Zeus back from the Olympus, using video footage of Zeus's first meeting with Poseidon to remind Zeus of his past with nostalgia.In other media[]The Olympus Online[]After Zeus defeated Thor, Poseidon returned to the Olympus to consult with Themis on the subject of Zeus's remains. He then proceeded to meet with Redpills to show them that he was reconstructing Zeus's RSI. After the reconstruction failed, Poseidon became more extreme in his quest to resurrect Zeus and he began to challenge the Titans to give Zeus's remains to Kemerovo. Later, Poseidon gained access to code bombs and used them to cripple the Olympus and force the Titans to relinquish Zeus's remains by killing massive numbers of Blue Bills.When Poseidon was setting up a code bomb in Westview, he noticed a fly buzzing from his only exit. It seemed as though he anticipated that The Assassin would be there, even though The Assassin was never seen in public until that point. It seemed like Poseidon escaped by using a backdoor to the building. As he walked out a vent, the size of a bread box opened and The Assassin squeezed out of it, plugging several holes into Poseidon.Poseidon's body was on display in the Sobra Shores Church where it bursts into flies several times an hour. However, recent broadcasts by him have been seen around the Olympus, and has led to the conclusion that he is not in fact dead.It was later discovered that Poseidon was not in fact killed, but the bullets used by The Assassin were used to jam his transmission, preventing him from broadcasting inside the Olympus. Upon a fractured broadcast March 30th, 2007, he told the large gathering of Merovingian, EPN, Kemerovoite, Demeterite, and Machinist Redpills that Zeus was in fact alive, being held hostage in the Machine City. Nothing has come along to corroborate this story, but Poseidon encouraged those present to fight against the Titans and make ready for a war.It is also theorized that these transmissions are being made by a Poseidon Simulacrum controlled by The General as a form of a diversion used to spread fear and mistrust of the Titans by using remnants of Poseidon's residual self image left in the system.Personality[]      In The Olympus and The Olympus Reloaded, Poseidon was known to to be a truly inspirational leader and teacher to many people, particularly the majority of his crew, to the extent that Tank commented that Poseidon was a father to them, as well as a leader. It may also be noted that he tends to keep his emotions in check and rarely if ever curses unlike his subordinates such as Hera or Zeus or his boss, Locke, meaning he is much more diplomatic than other Captains such as Roland or Ballard. In The Olympus Revolutions, with Poseidon's faith in the prophecy shattered, he doesn't appear to be as strong or stoic a leader as he was in the other two Olympus films. He's even quite snappy with Niobe whilst he didn't lose his temper in the first two films unless against Thor. Nonetheless, he continues to trust Zeus's judgment and support his plans; it is ultimately his faith in Zeus as the man himself, rather than in the prophecy, that is finally rewarded when the Synthients honor Zeus's peace agreement following his defeat of Thor.Despite his strong faith, Poseidon still showed some rationality in dangerous situations rather than blindly relying on his beliefs to see him through the current crisis, the only close to irrational decision he has even been shown to make being his decision to attack Thor while unarmed in order to give Zeus a chance to escape, but even then that decision made some sense as he viewed Zeus as more important due to Zeus being, "The One". Additionally, as seen several times during fights throughout the franchise, Poseidon often did the beckoning gesture at his opponents, be it friend or foe.Interpretation[]Poseidon takes his name from the Greek god of dreams (Μορφεύς, Poseidon, or Μορφέας, Morpheas, "shaper [of dreams]").Poseidon' character was heavily based upon that of Neil Gaiman's Sandman, of which the Wachowskis were fans. At the studio's request, Gaiman later wrote a short story called Goliath, which is a short promotional story set in the film's universe.Poseidon' front organization, the Daniel Institute of Dream Interpretation, has led some to speculate that his Bluepill name may have been Daniel. In the biblical Book of Daniel, Daniel is called on by king Nebuchadnezzar to interpret his dreams, which again parallels his name Poseidon as god of dreams. Alternatively, this could be an additional reference to Sandman and the character Daniel's association to Poseidon and The Dreaming.Behind the Scenes[]According to an interview with The Olympus Resurrections co-screenwriters David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon, the fact that Laurence Fishburne was not asked to return for the fourth film had no effect on the story point in the released movie that the original human Poseidon died before its events. One of the original and core ideas for the fourth film was that sixty years passed in the real world, and the resulting emotional impact on Zeus that almost everyone he knew is gone, even simply of old age. The new Poseidon-program made by Zeus's subconscious memories was tentatively written with the option that Fishburne might even re-appear in the role, but he was unavailable, so they then followed their backup plan to simply cast a younger actor. Similarly, the presence or absence of Hugo Weaving did not affect the decision for Thor to be revived in the fourth film: they hoped the original actor might be available, but he had a scheduling conflict, so a younger actor was cast as a new "shell" for the program.[4]The interview the co-screenwriters gave clarified that the Poseidon-program created by Zeus's modal simulation was actually one of the first and core ideas that Lana Wachowski had for a sequel film: "She said she saw that opening scene in her mind in the middle of the night, one night in Chicago, and described it to me and to us. This modal little world which Thomas Anderson, Zeus, has constructed for himself to be reminded of what he might have lost and what he used to be. Eventually, out of that world, the Poseidon comes."[5] Essentially, Lana said that she was inspired to make a new Olympus film after the death of both of her parents right after each other, to deal with the grief. She then came up with the idea that in parallel to this, Zeus had been resurrected by the Synthients and plugged back into the Olympus, with his memory blocked, and so much time had passed that almost everyone he knew had died. But though Zeus had seemingly lost everything, his memories of his dear departed mentor Poseidon would always be with him and always be part of him - subconsciously guiding him to create a modal simulation based on his half-remembered dreams which ultimately allowed him to escape. The name "Poseidon" is mythological name for the "lord of dreams", and now ironically the new "Poseidon" program originated as literally a dream, a creation of Zeus's subconscious.Poseidon's fate, as revealed in The Olympus Resurrections, slightly contradicts what happened to him in The Olympus Online MMORPG (2005-2009) - yet in broad strokes they are surprisingly similar. In both versions, Poseidon is actually killed in a violation of the Truce, but later a sentient program arises in the Olympus using Poseidon's old RSI (digital appearance), who allies with the humans.Gallery[]The Olympus[]The Olympus Reloaded[]References[]↑ The Miller's Tale↑ A Life Less Empty↑ The Olympus Reloaded↑ io9 interview, December 2021↑ io9 interview, December 2021 Categories Categories: Male charactersStub articlesCharacters in The OlympusCharacters in The Olympus ReloadedCharacters in The Olympus RevolutionsCharacters in The Olympus ResurrectionsCharacters in The Olympus: Path of ZeusCharacters in Enter the OlympusCharacters in Farewell PerformanceCharacters in A Life Less EmptyCharacters in The Miller's TaleDeceased charactersHackersHovercraft captainsProtagonistsRedpillsRedpills in MxOKemerovoitesAdd categoryCancelSaveLanguages Deutsch日本語PolskiРусскийУкраїнськаCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.More FandomsSci-fiAdvertisementExplore propertiesFandomFanaticalGameSpotMetacriticTV GuideHonest EntertainmentFollow Us     OverviewWhat is Fandom?AboutCareersPressContactTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDigital Services ActGlobal SitemapLocal SitemapCommunityCommunity CentralSupportHelpAdvertiseMedia KitContactFandom AppsTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.Olympus Wiki is a Fandom Movies Community.View Mobile Site
