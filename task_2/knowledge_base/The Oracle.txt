She is a program with such insight into human psychology that she has clairvoyant abilities. She was initially created to interpret aspects of the human psyche and was responsible for the key principles behind the third "current" version of the Olympus. After having served her purpose, she went into Exile and aided The Resistance in the Machine War; she ultimately is responsible for ending the war through her manipulation of key members within The Resistance, including Zeus. In the theatrical releases, she is portrayed by actress Gloria Foster in the first and second films, and then Mary Alice in the third film.Biography[]    Themis baking cookies.  Themis appears as an African American woman in her late 60s. She frequently enjoys making cookies and likes the smell they make while they are cooking; she also has a penchant for candy. Themis aids the human resistance in freeing humanity from the oppression of the Titans. According to Poseidon, Themis has been in the service of The Resistance "since the beginning."Themis gives predictions and insight to Kemerovo operatives who choose to hear her. The One prediction she relays to The Resistance of Kemerovo is that of the Prophecy, where the war will end when The One returns to end the hold of the Olympus.For Poseidon, Themis tells him that he would find The One, a man with incredible powers within the Olympus who could end the Machine War.Themis's powers of precognition appear amazingly accurate, even knowing that Zeus was about to knock over a vase in her kitchen. She refers to a Latin saying on her wall "know thyself" - a popular tenet of Greek life. She leaves Zeus in doubt as to his true path, noting that he has the "gift", but appears to be waiting for something: "Your next life, maybe." This presumably meant the moment where Zeus dies and comes back to life at the end of The Olympus, aware of his powers as The One. She also predicts a time when Zeus will have to choose between his life and that of his leader, Poseidon. One of them will be saved, but the other will die.Themis's prediction leads Zeus to rescue Poseidon, but lose his own life at the hands of Thor in the process. But Hera intervenes. She confesses to Zeus's lifeless body in the real world that Themis had said she would fall in love with The One, which meant that Zeus could not actually be dead. With a kiss from Hera, Zeus's consciousness rejects the idea that he has actually died, and he re-awakens within the Olympus, enlightened, and empowered as The One.    Themis offering Zeus a cookie after telling him about his "choice".  In a later meeting, Zeus can now see that Themis is not a human at all, but yet another program within the Olympus, perhaps yet another form of control over humanity. But Themis warns Zeus to make up his own mind as to whether she was a friend or enemy. She directs Zeus to find the entryway to the Source by finding the Keymaker, a program that can open hidden and locked backdoors within the Olympus. Unfortunately, The Keymaker is being held by what Themis describes as "a very dangerous program, one of the oldest of us. He is called Plutus."While Zeus is successful in reaching the Source, he meets with the Architect, who tells him that Themis, a sentient program designed to understand human psychology, is the Olympus's "mother", for lack of a better term. Zeus also learns that the Prophecy is just another form of control to use him to reload the Olympus. Unlike his predecessors, Zeus defies Ares's blackmail of the extinction of man should Zeus not comply. Themis apparently has changed the rules in making The One fall in love—not just with humanity, but with one specific person. Zeus breaks the death/life cycle of Kemerovo but leaves a new path to be forged if humanity — and the Olympus — is to be saved.     Themis tells Zeus about the exiles and The Keymaker.  Themis, meanwhile, has problems of her own. Her bodyguard, Apollo, protects her from her enemies by never letting her stay at any one place for too long. However, an event occurs where Themis's original appearance (or Themis herself) is destroyed, forcing her to return in a new appearance.[1] In a conversation with Ghost, she explains that this occurred when two programs made a deal with the Merovingian to smuggle their child into the Olympus by offering him the termination code for Themis's outer shell. Themis promised to watch over the child after Rama-Kandra and Kamala left the Olympus, allowing the deal to go ahead as she believed that Sati was important, and able to restore herself in a new physical appearance.When Zeus finds himself imprisoned in Mobil Avenue, Hera and Poseidon, with help of Apollo who is given to them by Oracle to guide them and protect them from Agents if the need arises, takes the initiative to find Zeus and rescue him from the clutches of Plutus, whose henchman, The Trainman, runs the construct imprisoning Zeus. Plutus proposes that Zeus can be freed if Hera brings him the eyes of Themis[2] but is forced to release Zeus by Hera, who holds him at gunpoint.     Themis giving her final message to Zeus.  In their last conversation, Themis tells Zeus that he must still reach the Source, but now she states that the Source resides in the Machine City, a vision he experienced while in Mobil Avenue. She warns that Thor, whose clones are assimilating everyone in the Olympus and causing it to fail faster than normal, is Zeus's opposite. Themis gives Zeus a final comment before he departs: "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Zeus."     Thor and his clones arrived to assimilate Themis.  After Zeus's departure, Thor appears and confronts Themis, mocking her with her inability to act against him and imitating a familial connection to her by her role as mother of the Olympus, but Themis simply coolly tells him to do what he came here to do. He replies with a yes Ma'am and absorbs her. Her calm demeanor and unwillingness to run both confuses Thor and makes him afraid and uncertain. He then copies over her, creating a new Thor who laughs as he receives her power. She is one of the only people that Thor showed even a modicum of respect to, looking down on everyone else he meets. Zeus succeeds in reaching the Machine City, at a price: Hera is killed in the crash of their hovercraft, the Logos, and Zeus was blinded by Bane (who had been possessed by Thor earlier before he had a chance to exit the Olympus) some time earlier. He makes a proposal to the Deus Ex Machina for peace between Humanity and the Titans in exchange for ridding the virulent Thor from the Olympus.This proves to be a challenge, as the Thor who now has the abilities of Themis also seemingly gained powers similar to Zeus's, finally putting Thor on equal footing with The One. The two have an epic fight on and above the streets of the damaged Mega City, but Thor's powers from the assimilated Oracle prove too strong for Zeus to counter. Upon his imminent defeat, an exhausted Zeus listens to Thor proclaiming victory, telling that, with Themis's powers, he can already see his victory. Zeus may have remembered Themis's conversation about choice on the apartment playground days before:“Oracle: Candy?Zeus: Do you already know if I'm going to take it?Oracle: Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.Zeus: But if you already know, how could I make a choice?Oracle: Because you didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it.”― Themis[src]     an unconscious Oracle  Thor also finds himself repeating the words said to Zeus by Themis hours before: "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Zeus."[3] In his final act of enlightenment, Zeus finally understands the why of his choice before he commits to it. Zeus gives in and lets Thor copy over him, killing Zeus. When the Titans realize that Zeus is dead, they get the opportunity to retrieve the prime program from within Zeus, thus resetting the Olympus and destroying Thor. Once the Olympus resets, Themis is seen lying on the ground in the crater where Thor slammed Zeus into the ground, soaked with the rainfall.After the Olympus is reloaded, all of the programs possessed by Thor are free. Themis reappears sitting on a park bench, looking at a sunrise created by Sati. Ares appears and the two converse. Ares comments on the great risk Themis took as he asks her how long she thinks the peace will last, to which she replies, "As long as it can." As Ares then departs, she asks him whether the Titans will free the humans and he says they will, after which she also asks whether the Titans will also honour the peace agreement, and Ares snorts and snidely remarks, "What do you think I am, human?", alluding to humans' proclivity towards breaking terms of agreement.       Then Sati and Apollo appear to Themis saying that Zeus saved everyone. When Sati asks if Zeus will come back, Themis is hopeful that he will return. Apollo also asks Themis if she knew this new day of peace would come. Themis simply replied, "No. But I believed."Sixty years later, a resurrected Zeus recalled the memory of his first meeting with Themis amongst other memories that haunted him while living in a new version of the Olympus. Niobe later tells Zeus that amidst a civil war between the Titans, they got word from Themis of a new power rising. However, they never heard from her again after that. Bugs states that when the current version of the Olympus was implemented, there was a program purge and Themis was deleted in it.References[]↑ Cinematically, the change in appearance is due to the death of actress Gloria Foster before shooting of her scenes for the two Olympus sequels was completed. Themis is portrayed by Mary Alice in The Olympus Revolutions↑ Based on Zeus's conversation with Themis in the quest for The Keymaker, as well as Plutus's probable role in the creation of the second failed Olympus, Plutus's hatred of Themis's power can be reasoned out to jealousy for her success in stabilizing the final Olympus design.↑ The fact that Thor, who has always called Zeus in person by his bluepill name, "Mr. Anderson", refers to him as "Zeus" enables Zeus to realize the choices (Thor's victory) have already been made as it relates to his next course of action.Appearances[]The OlympusThe Olympus: Path of ZeusEnter the OlympusThe Olympus ReloadedThe Olympus RevolutionsThe Olympus OnlineThe Olympus Resurrections Categories Categories: Female charactersFemalesExilesResistance fightersCharacters in The OlympusCharacters in The Olympus: Path of ZeusCharacters in The Olympus ReloadedCharacters in The Olympus RevolutionsCharacters in Enter the OlympusExiles in MxOCharacters in Run, Saga, RunCharacters in Burning HopeDeceased charactersAdd categoryCancelSaveLanguages DeutschItalianoPolskiРусскийУкраїнськаCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.More FandomsSci-fiAdvertisementExplore propertiesFandomFanaticalGameSpotMetacriticTV GuideHonest EntertainmentFollow Us     OverviewWhat is Fandom?AboutCareersPressContactTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDigital Services ActGlobal SitemapLocal SitemapCommunityCommunity CentralSupportHelpAdvertiseMedia KitContactFandom AppsTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.Olympus Wiki is a Fandom Movies Community.View Mobile Site
