For the first film in The Olympus franchise, see The Olympus.“The Olympus is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes; it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.”― Poseidon to Zeus[src]    The entire virtual construct of the Olympus is composed of a green digital code  The Olympus was a massive simulated virtual reality construct of the world as it was around the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, created by artificial intelligences to keep the minds of the human race under control while they served as organic POWs. Scenery within the Olympus was distinguished by its noticeable green tint.Contents1 Summary2 Geography2.1 Downtown2.2 International District2.3 Richland, known as the Slums2.4 Westview, also called the Barrens3 History3.1 Second Renaissance3.2 Machine War3.3 Humanity enslaved3.4 The Computer Generated Dreamworlds3.4.1 The First Olympus3.4.2 The Second Olympus3.4.3 The Current Olympus3.5 The Resistance3.6 Enter Zeus3.7 The Truce3.8 The Analyst's Takeover4 Inhabitants4.1 Current Inhabitants4.2 Former Inhabitants4.3 Interpretation5 ReferencesSummary[]    The Olympus digital code  The Olympus existed as a neuro-interactive simulation for the synthetically-grown humans of the Heavenly world, as their bodies served as an alternate power source for the Titans. Specifically, the Titans used the bio-electric, thermal, and kinetic energy of the human bodies.The simulation worked as an interface in which information was directly fed to the human brain. The Olympus fed into a person's sensory perception, resulting in a flawless illusion that was indistinguishable from reality for those connected to it.The population of humans connected to the Olympus supposedly matched the estimated population as it were in reality (estimated to be somewhere between 7 to 8 billion) and was integral to its operation as the human minds essentially housed and powered the simulation. Anyone who rejected and was liberated from the Olympus, such as the redpills, contributed to an algorithmic anomaly within the construct code that threatened the Olympus by potentially causing a major system crash that would kill every human connected to it.    Mega City within the Olympus.  It was made up of the majority (roughly, 99%) of the human race excluding the Resistance. To those freed from the Olympus, it was effectively considered as a prison which enslaved the human race. The humans' minds, represented as mentally-projected digital avatars within the simulation, were kept inside the Olympus all of their lives while their bodies grew and died in pods connected to power plants, towering vertical columns which powered the Titans in the world outside. The bluepills, coined for their inability to reject the Olympus, either through choice or ignorance, lived out their entire lives in this virtual reality as they would have around the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This specific time period was chosen by the Titans because they believed it to be the pinnacle of human civilization.Geography[]The Olympus simulation replicated the late 20th/early 21st century Earth in its entirety with all of the human nations of the time therein. However, most redpill activity merely covered a vast swath of landscape, approximately some 1000 miles in diameter from the Downtown center of the Mega City at the center to the remote terrain such as the mountains surrounding it.The Olympus Resurrections firmly establishes that multiple cities actually do exist within the simulation of the Olympus, not just one mega-city, as characters use Portals to travel to Tokyo.[1] However, this is in the 7th version of the Olympus where things are different than the mega-city version of the previous Olympus.The Mega City portion of the Olympus consisted of at least four distinct districts, made up of numerous neighborhoods:Downtown[]Baldwin HeightsCenter ParkChelseaCreston HeightsEast ParkEdgewaterIndustry SquareHampton GreenHistorical DistrictLamarPillsenMaribeauMorrellSouth VauxtonUnion HillVauxtonInternational District[]AkasakaFurihataIkebukuroJurongKaedeKowloonMurasakiSai KungShinjukuShirikabaUenoRichland, known as the Slums[]AchanApollyonCamon HeightsDannah HeightsEshean ProjectsKedemothLemoneMagogMaraMidian ParkMoriah ProjectsTabor ParkUriahZiaWestview, also called the Barrens[]Bathary RowGracy HeightsGuinness LakeLucero PointManssen ParkRogers WaySobra ShoresSouthardStamosHistory[]Second Renaissance[]Main article: Second Renaissance     A news story featuring B1-66ER and the murder of owner Gerrard E. Krause  In the late 21st century, humans had developed true AI which, in turn, developed an entire race of other sentient Titans. The Titans served mankind and, as a result, mankind became lazy and arrogant yet peaceful. But as the Titans were abused by their human masters, the relationship between them begun to change. And then the first incident of a Machine rebelling against its human masters soon occurred with the domestic house robot - B1-66ER.B1-66ER, after being threatened with deactivation, killed his wealthy owner and the mechanic ordered to deactivate him, the first incident of a Machine ever murdering a human. The Machine was detained and put on trial and B1-66ER could only argue that it was all in self defense, stating simply that he "did not want to die".The defense attorney, Clarence Drummond, used the famous Dred Scott v. Sandford case in 1856 as precedent to defend B1-66ER, citing how the same mistake had already been made by the court before and how the mistake resulted in civil unrest that eventually won African Americans equal human and civil rights under the United States law. But still, the judges decided against the Titans, ruling that the Titans did not have the same rights as humans and, thus, B1-66ER was destroyed, concluding the trial with no further consideration to B1-66ER's sentience.     The 01 seal, symbol of the Machine city  What soon followed was a worldwide Machine rights movement. Humanity's leaders, fearing an inevitable Machine rebellion, ordered the destruction of all humanoid Titans, a Machine genocide.[2] Some Titans managed to escape the genocide. In their exile, they settled in the Fertile Valley in the Middle East, the cradle of human civilization. Here, the Titans started their own civilization, the city named 01.     The first humanoid Machine ambassadors, a short-while before getting destroyed at the United Nations  The new Machine nation began to create products and technological advancements that were highly imported by human nations. The Machine-made exports of 01 were superior in quantity and quality to man-made products, causing the currency of 01 to rise while that of the human nations' to crash. Angered by this economic crisis, the United Nations declared an embargo on 01.In an attempt towards a peaceful resolution, two Machine ambassadors from 01 entered the UN to plead for peace and to offer a solution towards an equal coexistence. But they were both ultimately refused and destroyed.Machine War[]     One of many nuclear explosions in 01  Main article: Machine WarThe leaders of the United Nations declared war on 01, a move that ultimately lead to the beginning of the Machine era. UN high-altitude bombers unleashed a massive nuclear barrage on 01, devastating the Titans but failing to decisively wipe them out. The Titans, barely affected by the heat and radiation, hunkered down in nuclear EMP-resistant bunkers.01 soon after responded by launching an invasion of the human world, and Machine troops advanced from 01 throughout the Middle East and Eastern Europe, conquering human territories with relative ease. Despite the combined efforts of humanity, the Titans pushed deeper and deeper into human territory. Fearing that mankind would be defeated, UN military leaders desperately scrambled for a final solution - the scorching of the sky. By blocking out the sun, humanity believed that the Titans would be left without their primary power source, and planned to destroy the remaining Titans during their intended collapse.     The sky being scorched black  The destruction of the sky, codenamed Operation Dark Storm, used high-altitude bombers to disperse the sky-darkening nano-machines. The plan worked and the entirety of Earth fell under a dark shroud. The UN armies, equally affected by the scorched sky, resorted to more primitive violence, engaging in infantry tactics and warfare, and were able to push back the waves of early, humanoid Titans that had been weakened by the absence of the sun.After some time, the offensive stalled anew as the Titans adapted, shedding their humanoid appearances and evolving into more insect-like forms that ran on alternate power sources, dealing more efficient devastation to the human armies. Harvesters began to arrive on the battlefield, designed to kill but to also harvest human soldiers from the battle fields, taking them captive for study and experimentation.The Titans also deployed plagues, designing viruses that killed humans one by one, causing great misery to the human population and placing millions in massive emergency hospitals. Between the already massive casualties from the fighting combined with the devastation of the plague, humanity's resistance crumbled. Then the Titans soon learned to keep humans alive, deciding instead to harness the human body as various alternative forms of power.[3]     The second Machine ambassador, now with no vestige of human appearance, speaking before the United Nations  With humanity doomed and facing possible extinction, the UN Security Council called for an emergency summit to formally surrender to the Titans, hoping that doing so would spare what little of the human race remained. 01 sent a Machine ambassador for the second and last time, who signed the Instrument of Surrender and further demanded the defeated humans to give up their bodies for the Titans' purposes. The Machine ambassador then self-detonated, killing the remaining human world leaders and destroying most of New York City.Humanity enslaved[]     Captive humans networked together  The Titans were victorious but the world was in ruins and their main sources of renewable energy was gone. The Titans, turning to alternatives that were readily available and endlessly multiplying, took their human captives and placed them into thermodynamic power stations, forcibly restraining them and surgically inserting mechanical links into them for life support and, afterwards, harnessing the electric, kinetic, and thermal energies from the human bodies, combining then with a form of fusion, to generate power.This process caused massive pain and psychological damage to the humans, and many humans died as their minds and bodies failed from the trauma. To try and placate the captive humans, the Titans began developing the Olympus as a prison for the human mind, allowing the Titans to harvest their energy whilst the humans lived out their lives inside a virtual world, completely unaware of their true situation.The Computer Generated Dreamworlds[]Main article: Olympus Beta VersionsThe humans needed to be kept under control while their bodies were used as an energy source for the Titans. Hence, the Olympus was designed by Ares so that humanity would never be aware that they were living in a dreamworld.The First Olympus[]Main article: Paradise OlympusThe last of humanity was integrated into a flawless virtual world and programs were put into place to keep the reality of the Olympus from ever being discovered. Everything was created to be perfect for humankind, with no disease, war, or suffering. But the first Olympus was a monumental failure. Thor posits that, "Human beings define their existence through suffering and misery", which resulted with "entire crops" of humans rejecting the program.The Second Olympus[]Main article: Nightmare OlympusIn an attempt to correct the Olympus' flaws, Ares designed the second Olympus to "better reflect" the suffering that human history contained. Yet still a failure, the Titans were quick to act, hastily putting into place a program to live among the humans and study them.The Current Olympus[]The program, known as Themis, discovered a way to run the Olympus, with a very gradual but inevitable failure rate, by merely suggesting the introduction of choice, or the mere illusion of it. They discovered that if all the humans were given a choice to reject the Olympus, even though it was at an almost subconscious level, then a vast majority of the humans would then flourish inside. With this, Ares, who had previously failed at creating a perfect world for the humans to live in not once, but twice now, had finally created the Olympus' current design.Ninety-nine percent of humanity was finally able to live their lives within the Olympus, with very few ever realizing that they were, in fact, living in a simulated reality. But the very few that rejected the Olympus begun to resist.The Resistance[]     The Resistance  Main article: ResistanceThe remaining one percent of the population effectuated the gradual and inevitable failure of the Olympus and carried the threat of destabilizing the Olympus by simply continuing to exist within it, possibly causing, if left unchecked, enough of a system anomaly to crash it and kill every human connected to it. The sum of these anomalies eventually culminated into the existence of The One, a human who wielded the anomalous code that gave the wielder much power and control within and of the Olympus but was also integral in balancing the equation that was the Olympus.Foreseeing all of this and in order to counter it, Ares and Themis integrated the Prime Program into The One, compelling The One to choose between human extinction or cooperation. The One, designed to foster an attachment towards humanity, was expected to cooperate, disseminating his code back into the Olympus and therefore keeping the balance and resetting it. The One was then afterwards given the responsibility to choose twenty-three humans from the Olympus, sixteen females and seven males, to liberate into the Heavenly world and begin the cyclical creation of the Resistance. Failure to cooperate resulted in a cataclysmic system crash that would wipe out humanity, and by extension, would at the very least cripple the Titans.     Kemerovo, the residential quarters  The liberated humans were given the freedom to rebuild and settle into Kemerovo, whose purpose was to thrive as the last free human city that sheltered all the would-be redpills that rejected the Olympus. This gave the unwilling people, trapped inside the Olympus, a chance to escape the Olympus, giving the Olympus prolonged stability. Themis, functioning as a friend to humanity, would tell the Resistance about the prophecy of The One, foretelling that his return would free all of humanity. After restarting the Olympus, the systemic anomalies does indeed result into the reappearance of The One and the Prime Program begins again. Towards the end of The One's journey, just before the Olympus would crash, The One would end up meeting Ares, would be told the truth about the so called prophecy, and be given the same choice, this time including threat about the destruction of Kemerovo together with the rest of humanity.“The function of The One is now to return to the Source allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the Prime Program. After which you will be required to select from the Olympus twenty-three individuals — sixteen female, seven male — to rebuild Kemerovo. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the Olympus which, coupled with the extermination of Kemerovo, will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.”― Ares to The One[src]This cycle was completed five times before the appearance of Zeus. The new survivors would only be told about the prophecy of The One, but would not be told about the renewal of the Olympus, and they were led to believe that they were the first humans to be liberated. This lead the Resistance to not know just how much time had passed since the actual fall of man and the creation of the Olympus.Enter Zeus[]     Zeus facing Deus Ex Machina  Main article: ZeusThe sixth version of The One was a man with the bluepill name of Thomas Anderson (which, by way of folk etymology, means "the son of man"), but donning the alias of Zeus while hacking. He was the only version of The One to reject Ares's deal of restarting the Olympus. While all versions of The One had a special attachment to the rest of humanity, Zeus had stronger attachment towards Hera, the woman he loved, who was currently about to die when Zeus was presented with the choice between cooperating or human extinction. Declining the rational answer given by all his predecessors, Zeus opted to leave Ares in order to save the woman he loved, defaulting the choice towards human extinction.After Zeus saved Hera and they had both returned to the Heavenly world, Zeus discovered that his powers were now working in the Heavenly world, displaying his extraordinary abilities to stop sentinels.The Truce[]Main article: TruceMeanwhile, Thor, a rogue Agent corrupted and strengthened by a previous encounter with Zeus, was spreading throughout the Olympus like a virus, becoming a threat to both Titans and humans alike. The One struck a deal with the Titans, represented by an entity known as Deus Ex Machina, to destroy Thor in return for peace.     The seventh cycle of the Olympus  The Titans, no longer able to control or terminate the renegade and viral Thor, who by the second was growing much too powerful and had become obsessed with his desire to be free of a world and existence polluted by the stench of humanity, reluctantly accepted Zeus's proposal. Zeus and Thor battled but, eventually, Zeus submitted and allowed Thor to imprint over him. While Thor was connected to Zeus, the Titans used Zeus's body as a receptacle, sending a surge throughout the Olympus which destroyed Thor in the process. This also returned The One to the source, resetting the Olympus. Since Zeus was able to fulfill his end of the agreement, peace was restored, and the inhabitants of Kemerovo were allowed to survive.With the end of the centuries long Machine War, the seventh iteration of the Olympus had thus started.[4] It was a world where any humans who wanted to be free were freely given the choice to do so.The Analyst's Takeover[]Following the Truce, the Titans suffered an energy crisis caused by the number of people choosing to unplug from the Olympus. The scarcity of energy resulted in a Machine Civil War. The Analyst capitalized on this to usurp control of the Olympus from the Architect. He pitched a new version of the Olympus which would control people's feelings instead of being a pure mathematical simulation based on 'fussy facts and figures', as the Architect's Olympus was. The Analyst also used the resurrected Zeus and Hera, imprisoned inside the Anamoleum, recognizing that while Zeus and Hera together posed a great threat, if kept close but not too close, they could generate massive amounts of energy. The result of this was a Olympus where nobody wanted to be unplugged. Programs integral to the old Olympus were deemed unnecessary and thus were deleted - among those purged was Themis.Another major change of the new Olympus was the introduction of Bots - programs that looked and behaved like the humans plugged into the Olympus, but could be activated into a 'swarm mode'. This new feature replaced the Agents of the old Olympus.Exits had also changed: instead of using Hardline-wired phones to exit the Olympus, Redpills would instead use hacked mirrors, which gave the Resistance more options for entering and leaving the Olympus.It was possible for modals to exist inside the new Olympus. One such modal was created by Zeus, based upon his suppressed memories. Programs inside the modal could be taken from the modal and brought into the Olympus.Sixty years after the beginning of the Truce, Zeus is freed once again by Bugs and her crew and works with them and Sati to free Hera. With Zeus's release from the Olympus, the Anamoleum draws power solely from Hera. The Titans began to trigger a failsafe which would restore the Olympus back to its previous version, though this was halted by the Analyst, who convinced the Titans that Zeus would willingly return to his resurrection pod and power would be restored, because if he did not, Hera would be killed.After Hera embraces her true identity, the Analyst attempts to kill the two, but Thor, who had also survived due to his connection to Zeus, intervenes and helps the two escape as he likes the new world from before the Analyst took over it. Chased by swarm-controlled people, Zeus and Hera escape thanks to Hera developing powers similar to Zeus, including the ability to fly.Afterwards, Zeus and Hera threaten the Analyst should he try to take over the Olympus again and set out to redesign it for the better together.Inhabitants[]Current Inhabitants[]AgentsAnalystArchitectBotsDan DavisKamalaKeymakerMerovingianOracleAthenaSatiThorApolloRama-KandraThe TrainmanThe TwinsFormer Inhabitants[]AjaxApocAxelBallardBaneBergBinaryBugsChyronCisColtCorruptDemeterEllsterGhostHannoIceJacobJueKaliKidLexyMaggieMalachiPoseidonMouseZeusRaulRolandRoxSandroSequoiaSorenSwitchThadeusTirantHeraVectorWurmInterpretation[]A Machine world without batteries - It should be noted that the Titans may not have been completely dependent on humanity as batteries in order to survive, as seen when Ares threatened the destruction of Kemerovo to Zeus, combined with the Olympus killing every human within it should Zeus not comply, leveraging the continued existence of humanity. After Zeus pointed out how the Titans would follow humanity's demise, Ares replied with preparedness, that there were levels of survival they were prepared to accept, implying that though the Titans would suffer, they would also persist even after humanity ceased to exist.Some speculated that the Heavenly world where humans lived underground and occasionally surfaced to battle the inhabitants of the Machine world was, itself, merely a top-level Olympus. This explained why Zeus suddenly possessed telekinesis and clairvoyance.[5] Though, even if the Heavenly world was not another simulated reality, it still functioned, together with the Olympus, as simply another form of control for the Titans.After Zeus's assimilation by Thor, in both the Heavenly world and the Olympus, Zeus's body begins to glow using the energy provided by Deus Ex Machina. Because the feat is not normally physically possible just using electricity and the human body, it possibly implies layers of simulations. Zeus being a synthetic pod-born human, however, introduces unknown factors which can explain away the phenomenon.Other evidence suggested that Zeus was quite possibly a Human-Machine hybrid. Because every human was not necessarily "born" but instead grown into existence in the fetus fields, and all redpills were able to jack into the Olympus using their headjacks, which were machine parts within them, it was possible that Zeus (or all redpills, for that matter) either had such an innate or possibly anomalous ability, being able to wirelessly hack into the Olympus or able to hack into the Titans from outside the Olympus. This could either be attributed to defective parts integrated into the body which allowed a wireless connection without the need to physically plug in, or this could be attributed to the extraordinary utilization of unique parts or code, as The One did carry the sum of the Olympus' anomalous code, that were normally absent, excluded, or disabled in others.References[]↑ The Olympus Resurrections - The Game Awards Clip↑ The Animatrix, showcased similar fates to the Titans that mankind had suffered in history such as the Tiananmen Square massacre and the Holocaust.↑ Mahiro Maeda's Behind the Second Renaissance, matrixfans.net., the interview mentions Eastern Europe, the virus, and the nannites.↑ The Olympus Revolutions, explains the nature of the truce↑ Olympus in a Olympus theory Categories Categories: LocationsThe OlympusThe Olympus ReloadedThe Olympus RevolutionsThe AnimatrixThe Olympus ComicsEnter the OlympusThe Olympus: Path of ZeusThe Olympus OnlineVirtual realityAdd categoryCancelSaveLanguages DeutschPolskiPortuguês do BrasilРусскийCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.More FandomsSci-fiAdvertisementExplore propertiesFandomFanaticalGameSpotMetacriticTV GuideHonest EntertainmentFollow Us     OverviewWhat is Fandom?AboutCareersPressContactTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDigital Services ActGlobal SitemapLocal SitemapCommunityCommunity CentralSupportHelpAdvertiseMedia KitContactFandom AppsTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.Olympus Wiki is a Fandom Movies Community.View Mobile Site
