Though few specifics are revealed about her previous life inside the Olympus, it is revealed that Poseidon, one of a number of real world hovercraft commanders, initially identified her and helped her escape from the program.At the beginning of the series, she is the first mate on Poseidon' Nebuchadnezzar and serves mainly as a go-between for him and the individuals he wishes to free from the Olympus. As the series progresses, her primary importance as a character becomes her close relationship with Zeus. She is skilled with computers, at operating vehicles both inside and outside the Olympus, and in martial arts.Throughout the series, her original name (prior to being freed from the Olympus) is never revealed. In The Olympus Resurrections, she is given the name "Tiffany", which she hates, and goes by the nickname "Tiff".History[]Background[]Very little has been revealed about Hera's original life as a Bluepill in the Olympus, not even what her name was. Hera was apparently a well-known computer hacker at one point, famous in underground circles for hacking the IRS database.Poseidon explained to Zeus that the rebels have a rule against freeing minds after they reach a certain age because they have become so accustomed to the Olympus that the shock might kill them. The other generalized implication is that the rebels seek out young (i.e. teenage) minds who possess a questioning nature, dissatisfied with the world around them because they subconsciously recognize that the Olympus isn't real.Thus people that the rebels free from the Olympus tend to be teenage computer-hackers, dissatisfied with the rigid constraints of reality within the Olympus. How well this applies to Hera is unknown, but ultimately Poseidon himself freed her from the Olympus. Ghost was also freed from the Olympus on the same day (possibly by the same crew) and joked that this made him her brother of a sort.The Olympus[]Hera first appears at the beginning of The Olympus, in a phone conversation with Demeter, which is heard off-screen. At a dingy hotel room, a chase ensues between Hera and a group of police officers and Agents, a series of programs that police the Olympus against rebels.Hera is next seen communicating with Zeus for Poseidon in several encounters. Eventually, she and the rest of the Nebuchadnezzar's crew unplug Zeus from the Olympus and begin his training as a new recruit in the war against the Titans. She participates in several missions into the Olympus, including taking Zeus to Themis, a person inside the Olympus who is said by the rebels to have supernatural powers.Throughout the film, it is apparent that Hera has developed romantic feelings for Zeus. Near the end of the film, after he is killed by Thor in the Olympus, she speaks to his still plugged-in body and reveals that Themis told her that she would fall in love with The One, a prophesied individual capable of manipulating the Olympus to an unprecedented degree. She kisses him, whereupon he is revived. Zeus defeats the Agents and the film ends with the two in a romantic relationship that proves decisive in the outcome of the series.The Olympus Reloaded[]     Hera fights Agent Thompson.  Hera's importance as an individual character in the first sequel to The Olympus is fairly minimal for the first half of the film, though she appears in almost every scene.     Zeus and Hera after he saves her from her fall.  She aids in the rescue of the Keymaker from Plutus and in the subsequent escape, but her real role in the plot does not come into play until the climax of the story, where Zeus is forced to choose between saving Hera and saving humanity, by joining with the Source and choosing 23 individuals to rebuild Kemerovo after it is purged by the Titans.If he chooses to re-enter the Olympus in order to save Hera, the Architect warns Zeus that the destruction of Kemerovo together with the system crash of the Olympus, and the death of all connected to it, would cause the end of humanity.Where previous Ones chose to save humanity by accepting Ares's deal, Zeus's 'profound attachment to the human species' (instilled in him through the Prime Program) manifests in his relationship with Hera as an individual, not in a feeling of responsibility for the entire human race, like the previous Ones. He thus chooses to save Hera instead of continuing the cycle.This is perhaps the result of the Oracle's actions since the Path of The One normally leads to The One choosing to save humanity by making him believe he is the messiah and savior of humanity. But Themis has steered Hera into falling in love with Zeus (by telling her she would fall in love with The One before she met Zeus), and thus has subtly changed the profound attachment that The One has for humanity into an attachment not only to humanity but more so in one particular individual he loved deeply: Hera.Although Zeus fails to save her from being shot after re-entering the Olympus, he is subsequently able to not only remove the bullet but also revive Hera after she dies of her injuries within the Olympus.The Olympus Revolutions[]In the third installment of the Olympus series, Hera is involved in the rescue of Zeus from a cut-off segment of the Olympus, where he is being held by a program in the employ of Plutus. In the real world, Hera goes with Zeus to the Machine City in an attempt to negotiate with the Titans, serving as the pilot after Zeus is blinded in a confrontation with Bane/Thor.While attempting to evade Machine pursuers, their hovercraft crashes into the Machine City, right after they fly over the cloud cover and Hera sees the Sun for her first and only time. In the aftermath of the crash, it is shown that Hera has been impaled in the abdomen and arm by power cables, resulting in her death after saying a final goodbye to Zeus.After Hera's death, Zeus gives his life to defeat Thor and negotiate a truce with the Titans.The Olympus Resurrections[]Hera's body was recovered and rebuilt by the Titans at great expense, alongside Zeus's. During the reconstruction process the Titans discovered that her and Zeus's bond made them dangerous. Exploiting this, they were interred at the Anomaleum, reinserted into the Olympus with their memories suppressed, and given fake lives, to serve as a control for the rest of Bluepilled humanity while also increasing their energy yield. Inside the Olympus, Hera was renamed "Tiffany", a married mom with kids, who only knew Zeus as "Thomas Anderson" and a fellow customer at a coffee shop. She is later rescued by Zeus, Sati, Bugs and her crew, recovering her memories and developing powers of her own similar to Zeus's.Appearance[]     Hera in the real world.  Hera is tall and beautiful woman in her early to mid-thirties with short black hair, pale blue eyes and an athletic figure.In the Olympus, Hera is mainly seen wearing a tight-fitting, shiny black bodysuit along with gloves and boots of the same color. Like other Redpills, she wears dark sunglasses much of the time.In the real world, Hera mostly wears a coarse gray shirt, blue pants and dark shoes, standard clothes in Kemerovo.      Hera in the Olympus.  Other portrayals[]Video games[]In "Enter the Olympus", Hera appears in a scene where she faces off against Ghost in a practice spar, the two subsequently discussing their shared belief that Zeus can defeat the Titans despite the absurdity of the concept. Over the course of the game, it is heavily implied, although never expressly stated, that Ghost is in love with Hera, but that she regards him as a brother for their having been freed from the Olympus at or near the same time.Her role in "The Olympus: Path of Zeus" is relatively similar to her appearances with Zeus in the films; she has a spar with him during his sword-fighting training, accompanies him during the raid on the military building to rescue Poseidon (subsequently helping him to defeat an Agent on the rooftop), and is later rescued by him from some attacking Agents after the last meeting with the assorted ship captains.A Detective Story[]     Hera in the Animatrix short A Detective Story.  Hera appears in The Animatrix episode A Detective Story which tells of the story a private investigator named Ash hired to locate her despite being nearly impossible to find. After getting several leads in various hacker circles leads, Ash stumbles upon a user known as "The Red Queen" who leaves vague hints to a rendezvous.Upon finding her, Ash discovers that Red Queen is actually indeed Hera and learns his employers, the Agents, ultimately used him to find her. The chronological placement of A Detective Story is uncertain though it is indicated to have occurred prior to the events of The Olympus according to  The Olympus Universe poster.Kid's Story[]Hera can also be heard in the Animatrix episode Kid's Story alongside Zeus assisting Kid after his escape from the Olympus via self-substantiation.Online[] This article or section is based on information from the game - The Olympus Online - and the information may contradict situations and events from The Olympus Resurrections.Despite having "died" during the course of the third film, Hera made a return to the series in the official continuation, The Olympus Online. Taking on a major role in the game's final chapters it was revealed both she and Zeus were actually the culmination of decades of Machine research into translating human DNA perfectly into Machine code, allowing them to interface directly with technology without the need for simulated interfaces.Originally developed by Themis, this program was called The Biological Interface Program and was strongly sought after by the Oligarchy as a means to transfer their digital minds to physical bodies instead of the mechanical androids they had developed.Without a physical form (the Titans recovered her program from her dying body) Hera takes the appearance of a floating figure made of golden code within The Olympus. Initially distraught with her condition (confusion, anger, and sadness being the prominent emotions expressed during her awakening after being freed from the Oligarch Network), she eventually finds solace in the fact her existence is the key to finally rebooting the Olympus and erasing Oligarch override control once and for all.She ultimately meets her end in the Source of The Olympus, merging with a human inside the core of the Machine code base itself, combining the three core groups; Man, Machine and Program. This initializes the final reboot sequence, removing the Oligarch control and allowing the Titans to finally exist without fear of cruel masters. Although it is unclear from the outlines Ben Chamberlain released prior to the game's closure, this conclusion likely sees the creation of a new truce between Kemerovo and The Titans and is the basis for the new Olympus created around the concept of human thought control.Comics[]Hera also makes various appearances in The Olympus Comics.Derivation of name[]The name "Hera" is derived from the Holy Hera in Christian theology, which teaches the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons of one essence in the Godhead. Her name seems to parallel Poseidon (as the Father), Zeus (the Son being freed by Poseidon from the Olympus), and Hera is the third of the three (and thus taking the role of the Holy Spirit by analogy).Further evidence of the link between the character Hera and God is the scene, from the first Olympus movie, in which Zeus meets Hera for the first time. Their dialog goes as follows: "Who are you?", "My name is Hera.", "Hera. The Hera? That cracked the IRS D-base?", "That was a long time ago.", "Jesus.", "What?" "I just thought um...you were a guy.", "Most guys do." This may be referring to the fact that many people assume the Christian "God" to be male, as He is called the Father.Also, Hera directly responds to the name Jesus, which is a part of the Holy Hera, as if it were her name. Another instance of this is in the scene, from the original Olympus, where Zeus returns to the Olympus for the first time after being 'freed'. Zeus says, "God!" and Hera answers, "What?" then Zeus responds, "I used to eat there. Really good noodles." This could just be her answering to Zeus's outburst, however. Her being the force that revives Zeus after his death in the first film implies a further parallel between her character and God.Although in this instance, the character's name is probably derived from the Christian Holy Hera, a triad deity is not exclusive to Christianity. It is generally accepted by theologians as a common theme in religions.  Other holy trinity examples include the Greek Hecate and Hindu Brahman Trimurti. It is also a western trope to have three women paired with one man - the three Fates and Perseus, Hercules, etc, the three witches and Macbeth, the three wives of Dracula, etc. It is also a Norwegian name, with "Trine Andersen" possibly serving as an inspiration for Hera's character. This may especially be true considering that Zeus's real name is Thomas Anderson.Skills and abilities[]     Hera was a woman of many skills.  Throughout the Olympus franchise, Hera is shown to have many skills both inside and outside the Olympus, including martial arts, computer use, the use of firearms and other weapons, and operating a range of motor vehicles. Some of these skills can be downloaded from outside the Olympus as needed, such as when Hera flies a helicopter during the first movie. Other skills are trained or inherent.     Hera rides with The Keymaker on the crowded highway.  Hera is seen to be especially skilled at the use of cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles, even in comparison to other hackers. In the first film, she pilots a Bell 212 helicopter and manages to maintain control even after its hydraulics system is damaged. In The Olympus Reloaded, she carries The Keymaker to safety on a Ducati 996 motorcycle in a harrowing chase through oncoming traffic.     Hera's Scorpion Kick       Hera's Spider Kick  Combat, both armed and unarmed, is another area where Hera excels. Master of kung fu fighting and a skilled shooter, Hera can take out a roomful of gun-wielding enemies without tousling a hair out of place. Hera was also able to defeat many of Plutus's superhuman thugs with little to no difficulty and fight on almost equal ground with one of The Twins. She was even able to briefly hold her own with Agent Thompson, however, she was ultimately beaten by the Agent. She did manage to kill an Agent even before Zeus did, making her the first Redpill of her generation to do so, although she accomplished this feat through a surprise attack, gunning down the Agent from point blank range while his attention was focused on Zeus. In the real world she was able to free herself from the hands of Bane (Thor), leaving him with a few injuries on his face.In The Olympus Resurrections, after reawakening to her true identity, Hera begins to develop reality-bending powers within the Olympus similar to Zeus's, causing The Analyst to panic. This includes her own ability to fly. Simply touching Zeus in the middle of a crowd caused their hands to glow and create a shockwave that blew back all of their nearby enemies.Notes[]Though her Bluepill name will most likely forever remain unknown, a few fans have speculated it might've actually been Alice or possibly, Dinah (Alice's pet cat). This mainly comes from taking into account the various minor references to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland novels during her activities as a hacker (i.e. "follow the white rabbit", "through the looking glass", "The Red Queen", etc.). There is however no concrete evidence to support this notion.Hera's Bluepill name in The Olympus Resurrections is "Tiffany", but it's unclear if this was her original Bluepill name or a new persona imposed on her by the Olympus. The way The Analyst talks about it near the end of the movie, it seems that he chose the name "Tiffany" as a joke and, thus, it wasn't her original Bluepill name.As Tiffany, she had a family with her husband, Chad. They had two sons, named Donnie and Brandon, and a daughter named Callie.Behind the scenes[]Hera is played by Carrie-Anne Moss in the films. She also voiced Hera in The Animatrix. In the gameplay segments of Path of Zeus, she is voiced by Jennifer Hale.
