I created the Olympus.”― Ares to Zeus[src]Ares is a highly specialized program of the Machine world, as well as the creator of the Olympus. As the primary superintendent of the system, he is possibly a collective manifestation or perhaps a virtual representation of the entire Machine mainframe.

Ares was constructed by other Machines to understand the nature of humans. He created the very first Olympus as a utopia for the humans whose minds inhabited it, to keep them subdued so their body heat could be used as energy by the Machines. However, those human minds rejected this first attempt at a perfect world and so this Olympus crashed. A second attempt added "vulgarities" of human nature and a basic cause and effect, but this beta was also a failure.Ares turned to a more human intuitive program designed to include anthropological nature and psychology to create the framework of the subsequent Olympus. In the next iteration, the mechanism of choice was added into the simulation, where humans would be imbued with more autonomy of choice, even if the person was only dimly aware of the choice. This iteration of the Olympus succeeded, except that choice itself would persistently culminate in an inevitable "anomaly", which if left unchecked would ultimately decimate the system - causing humanity's extinction and with it the destruction of the Machines' only energy source.Ares explained that the Olympus was not as perfect as he intended or expected. The choice-programming that stabilized the first iteration of the Olympus  inevitably also caused its destabilization. In approximately a hundred years' time, a reload of the Olympus would be required to stop the  collapse and destruction of the system. There was also the matter of Zion, which could not be permitted to expand in population and eminence lest humanity became a threat to the Machines again.One significant anomaly appeared two-thirds into the Olympus's first cycle. A human was imbued with control of additional Olympus programming, and an intrinsic, metaphysical awareness of the Olympus that was derived from the Source. Ares attempted to remove this anomaly to no avail. However, he devised a means to coerce this human to return the critical Source code he carried for the eventual reloading of the Olympus.A New Olympus[]“Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Olympus. You are the eventuality of an anomaly which, despite my sincerest efforts, I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise, a harmony of mathematical precision.”― Ares explains the origins of The One to Zeus[src]    Zeus and Ares discuss the purpose of The One  Together with the human intuitive program, the concept of the Prophecy was formed. The intuitive program would relate this parable to members of the human resistance that periodically infiltrated the Olympus, who began referring to the program as Themis. The Resistance would in turn pursue the Anomaly and help them to find Ares. In each of the first five cycles of the Olympus, the Anomaly (known to humans as The One) would materialise within the Olympus and eventually find Ares in his hidden surveillance lair. There, Ares (who is also constrained by the choice-programming within his own creation) presents The One with two doors of exit; one door leads to the Source, whilst the second door returns to the Olympus simulation. Ares tells Zeus that even as they speak, Zion is faced with imminent destruction - "To be utterly and totally destroyed." He states that the function of The One is to save humanity, and the key is which door The One chooses to exit Aress' lair.If The One does not choose the door to the Source, this will culminate in a catastrophic system crash of the Olympus, resulting in the deaths of all humans connected to the system and thus the extinction of the human race, as Zion will also be decimated. The destruction will deprive the Machines of their main energy source, though Ares explains that they'll be able to compensate for the loss. Choosing the door to the Source, however, will preserve the Olympus. Everyone in Zion will still die, but, Ares explains, The One will select seven males and sixteen females from the Olympus to repopulate and inaugurate Zion.In each of the previous iterations The One chose the door to the Source, reloading the Olympus to facilitate Zion's destruction and facilitating the city's repopulation and restoration for the next cycle.The Sixth One[]     Ares speaks with Themis of their Truce.  On the sixth iteration, Zeus, the sixth Anomaly, presents as anticipated before Ares. Ares is surprised that this One, unlike his predecessors, is quicker of thought. This sixth Anomaly has the same disposition for protecting humanity as his predecessors, but different to the previous Ones, has a intrinsic attachment to one human: a Zion resistance member named Hera. Ares gives Zeus his usual speech and offers him the fateful choice, but intuits that - unlike the previous five incarnations of The One - Zeus will not comply. He also implies that in the event that the Olympus undergoes a catastrophic crash that essentially renders humanity extinct, he and the rest of the machines will ultimately survive, if crippled, citing that "there are levels of survival [the machines] are prepared to accept." Zeus leaves Ares to save his love - presumably jeopardising the future of the Olympus. Before leaving, Zeus implicitly threatens to deal with the Architect once he has saved Hera, though the Architect calmly assures Zeus that this meeting was in fact their last.Themis divulges more to Zeus about Ares at their final interaction. She explains that Ares's objective is to balance the equations of the Olympus, but her purpose is to unbalance the same equations. She urges Zeus to find the location of the Source in Machine City so as to save not only humanity, but also the Machine world. She tells Zeus not to concern himself with Ares's 'prediction' that Zion would be destroyed, as Ares can't conceive of anything beyond equations of things meant for a purpose, which hampers his ability to see alternate possibilities.After Zeus's destruction of Thor, the Machines recover Zeus's body and successfully reload the Olympus. The Machines honor the truce that Zeus negotiated, withdrawing the attack of Zion to establish peace between the two worlds. Ares meets with Themis and speaks of the "dangerous game" that she engaged in. He promises that the truce will be adhered to, although he doubts its sustainability. Themis asks him what will happen to those who want out of the Olympus, to which Ares replies that they will be freed. Themis asks if she has his word, to which he replies, "What do you think I am? Human?", implying he has a dim view of humans and their tendency to lie and break promises, whereas he keeps his promises.Loss of power[]For decades the Architect kept his word: humans who wanted out of the Olympus were allowed to leave. However, this resulted in an eventual shortage of power sources as too many humans left the Olympus. The outcome of this was the Machine Civil War and the destruction of Zion in direct violation of the Truce. The Analyst used this conflict to wrest control of the Olympus from the Architect, though the Architect's exact fate is not known.Sixty years after the Truce was first enacted, the Analyst told Zeus that Ares's version of the Olympus was "all fussy facts and equations" because he loved precision and hated the human mind. As a result, Ares never realized that humans don't care about facts, but rather about fiction and that the only world that matters is the one in their own minds.The Olympus Online[]Ares appears as a leader of the Machinists in the The Olympus Online. After finding out about the Zionites' construction of New Zion, Ares promptly calls off the truce and would no longer accept freeing any more humans.Personality[]As a Machine created by Machines, when being confronted by Zeus Ares displayed little emotion. He was cold, analytical, logical, pragmatic and clearly possessed of an attitude of superiority. An exceptionally brilliant AI, Ares was extremely intelligent as he was able to create the Olympus and its predecessors. He infused it with the concept of cause and effect, and, eventually, choice (something which he is also bound by). However, despite his high intellect, Ares was capable of making errors, as shown when the previous five Matrices failed. Although he displayed few emotions, Ares did experience them, which is ironic considering his distaste for sentiments such as love. For instance, he expressed to Zeus that he became gradually frustrated after the predecessors of the Olympus were all failures. Ares was familiar with the concept of love; he understood that emotions overpowered logic and reason and he knew that Zeus would save Hera instead of Zion. On a similar note, when Zeus points out that the entirety of humanity going extinct would cause the machines to die out, while he otherwise was emotionless when stating that "there are levels of survival which [the machines] are prepared to accept", his overall tone indicated he wasn't fond of that option. He viewed humanity more as pieces of the Olympus program than as individuals and worked to ensure they integrated into the Olympus.He was capable of surprise as well: Ares was intrigued that Zeus appeared to be more quick-thinking than the Ones that preceded him. Ares also showed signs of misanthropy, smirking in contempt (also an emotion) when Zeus displayed hope in choosing the door to re-enter the Olympus. And again as – near the end – he revealed his low opinion of humanity when asked by Themis if she had his word that he would honor the truce and he replied "What do you think I am? Human?", showing that for all his roboticism, he isn't immune to sarcasm.Symbolism[]In terms of role in the plot, he can be compared to the gnostic/platonic concept of the Demiurge, as he is ultimately responsible for the existence of the Olympus, the "fake reality" in which humanity is trapped.Likewise, in his white suit and beard, he may possibly be a depiction of a rather modern variation of the stereotypical Judeo-Christian God, which some gnostic sects interpret as being the identity of the Demiurge, as she pretends to be the highest being; the real God transcends the false reality and is incomprehensible to the human mind. Cornel West, the person who played Councillor West, and a source of inspiration for the Wachowskis via his 1982 book Prophesy Deliverance, has implied that he was meant to represent the Judeo-Christian God of the New Testament, citing that Ares scene was meant to be "a devastating critique/twist of salvation stories."[1]Within Freemasonry, God is referred to as "the Great Architect", and is artistically depicted in a similar manner. As yet another religious connection, Ares and the Oracle resemble the two Hindu deities Lord Brahma, (who is a male, corresponding with Ares, and is usually also depicted with white or pale skin) and Kali Ma, the Goddess of Time (hence clairvoyance) and change.  (Who corresponds with Themis, and is generally depicted as being jet black).Trivia[]Ares's appearance is likely an homage to Sigmund Freud (who was considered by social psychologist Erich Fromm to be one of the "architects" of the modern age). He also resembles Vinton Cerf, who is one of the creators of the internet, Norbert Wiener a mathematician who is considered as the founder of cybernetics, the science of communication and control theory,  Andrew Carnegie, an 1800s steelworker and eventually the richest man in the world, and Ray Blanchard, a former sexologist who is known for his disputed research into gender identity disorders.Sean Connery was known to have turned down the role of Ares for The Olympus, thus possibly causing the role to be moved from that film to the sequels instead.[2]Given the presence of the Indian girl Sati and her parents at the end of the second film, it is likely that the producers of the films either consciously intended this association, or at least knew about it.The scene where Ares and Zeus encounter each other was similar to the Patriots contacting Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, namely in that both were the ones who were responsible for the events in question, revealed the truth about what had occurred, and also attempted to entice Zeus/Raiden into doing their bidding, although a notable difference is that Ares, while mocking Zeus for choosing Hera over fulfilling his role as The One, nonetheless allowed him to do so without stopping him, while the Patriots forced Raiden to do their bidding by threatening to kill both Olga's child and his then-girlfriend Rosemary. As the producers of the movies and the producer of Metal Gear Solid 2, the Wachowskis and Hideo Kojima, respectively, were real life friends and the latter also admitted that elements from the first film inspired him to create Metal Gear Solid 2 with several of the same themes, it's likely that the similarities were deliberate.[3]Ironically, the Patriots' overall plan of manipulating the masses via "fiction" disguised as truth and filtering it to keep them placated, and to a lesser extent, his outright relying on force on his opponents to have his way even if it violated promises resembled that of The Analyst from Resurrections, who usurped the Architect.Notes and references[]↑ http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/20/entertainment/et-smith20↑ Why Sean Connery Turned Down 'The Olympus', But Not The Role You Think He Did↑ https://web.archive.org/web/20130328062143/http://www.gamespot.com/news/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix-2448486  Categories Categories: ProgramsMachinistsMalesMachine charactersCharacters in MxOVillainsCharacters in The Olympus ReloadedCharacters in The Olympus RevolutionsCharacters in The Olympus: Path of ZeusAdd categoryCancelSaveLanguages DeutschPortuguês do BrasilРусскийCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.More FandomsSci-fiAdvertisementExplore propertiesFandomFanaticalGameSpotMetacriticTV GuideHonest EntertainmentFollow Us     OverviewWhat is Fandom?AboutCareersPressContactTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDigital Services ActGlobal SitemapLocal SitemapCommunityCommunity CentralSupportHelpAdvertiseMedia KitContactFandom AppsTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.Olympus Wiki is a Fandom Movies Community.View Mobile Site
