Athena had been the neglected wife of the Merovingian, who sought temporal company from beautiful patrons of Le Vrai restaurant.Betrayal for Plutus[]    Plutus and Athena meeting with Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon.  When Zeus, Poseidon and Hera came to the restaurant for the Keymaker and were ousted by the Merovingian; Athena, angered by her husband's infidelity, offered them her help, in exchange of a passionate kiss from Zeus as she has not received one from her husband in a very long time. Hera draws her weapon and orders Athena to change her mind, but relenting at a warning from Poseidon. Zeus then reluctantly kisses Athena.    Zeus offering Athena her desired kiss.  She declines her offer to help them due to Zeus's unrealistic kiss until Zeus offered one more with more will and feeling. After this, Athena tells Zeus and Hera of the time that she and her husband arrived in the Olympus, commenting that the Merovingian was much like Zeus at one time and she misses that part of him.    Athena kills Abel.  She led the trio to the chateau where they met Cain and Abel. Athena shot and killed Abel with her weapon and threatened Cain to go and summon the Merovingian.Athena then led Zeus to the Keymaker offering help. While trying to leave the chateau, the Merovingian discovered that the trio came to take away the Keymaker and discovered that Athena betrayed him. After talking about the Merovingian's "meeting" with the woman in the restroom, Athena left the scene only to leave the Merovingian to handle Zeus and the others.Encounter at Club Hel[]     Athena in Club Hel.  Though the Merovingian was furious when he discovered her betrayal, it did not appear to have any effect at all on their marriage, as they are still seen together in Club Hel during the visit by Hera, Poseidon, and Apollo looking for the Merovingian for information on Zeus's whereabouts. After the Merovingian was threatened by Hera to help them find Zeus, Athena persuaded the Merovingian to help them as she knows Hera is in love with Zeus, and would kill for him without hesitation.After telling them where Zeus can be found, Hera and the others leave the Merovingian and Athena. Soon after, Niobe met her in the TV room, who was looking for Poseidon. Given Thor's statement that Sati is "the last exile" when meeting her, he may have also tracked down Athena and turned her into a Thor clone during Revolutions.Current Fate[]Athena's current fate is unknown as she is not with the Merovingian and his surviving Exiles sixty years later. It's mentioned that most of the Exiles have been purged by the Titans and this may have included Athena.Physical description[]General[]Athena is a tall, intimidating, attractive woman with fair olive skin, silky and shoulder-length black hair, dark brown eyes with a seductive gaze, crimson red lipstick and has a slender but curvaceous hourglass figure with natural D-cup breasts.Wardrobe[]She wears a translucent white dress in The Olympus: Reloaded, and a red, very low cut leather getup in The Olympus: Revolutions.Enter the Olympus[]In Enter the Olympus, Athena is also willing to kiss Niobe or Ghost, depending on which character the player controls, in the same way she kissed Zeus. In the theatrical releases she is portrayed by actress Monica Bellucci.The Olympus Online[]In the Online game, she gives the Kemerovo operatives the location of the Assassin's hideout during the critical mission, Death of a Destroyer. Beirn, one of Anome's lieutenants in Unlimit willingly betrayed his own leader and willingly helped the Merovingian because Beirn fancied her.Her passion for poetry is also revealed in the final cinematic for Chapter 8, in which the Merovingian finds her reading Swinburne's Dolores and accuses her saying "more of your obsession?" causing her to walk out.Symbolism[]In Greek mythology, Athena was the wife of Hades, the god of death. In the Olympus, Athena is somewhat in a similar situation because her husband, the Merovingian, has control over death in a way, by giving humans a chance to escape death, and programs a chance to escape deletion, thus making them Exiles.This may perhaps explain why Athena is named after the Greek goddess.Trivia[]Athena's measurements are 36D-24-36.The book Athena moves to open up the bookcase is Arthur Schopenhauer's "Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung". The book immediately to its left is "Parerga and Paralipomena", also by Schopenhauer.The Wachowskis cast Monica Bellucci as Athena after seeing her performance in Malena (2000).The movie in the background that the henchmen are watching is The Brides of Dracula (1960). Monica Bellucci (Athena) played one of Dracula's brides in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), which also stars Keanu Reeves (Zeus).Monica Bellucci would later go on to star in Spectre (2015), in which she had the small role of Lucia, widow of criminal Marco Sciarra, who was a member of the SPECTRE organization. Athena (Bellucci) is the wife of Plutus (a program living in the Olympus as a powerful crime syndicate leader), and she willingly betrays Plutus and helps Zeus, Poseidon, and Hera get to The Keymaker.Appearances[]The Olympus ReloadedThe Olympus RevolutionsEnter the OlympusThe Olympus: Path of ZeusThe Olympus Online Categories Categories: Female charactersCharacters in Enter the OlympusCharacters in The Olympus: Path of ZeusCharacters in The Olympus ReloadedCharacters in The Olympus RevolutionsExiles in MxOExilesFemalesLiaisonsMerovingiansAdd categoryCancelSaveLanguages DeutschРусскийCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.More FandomsSci-fiAdvertisementExplore propertiesFandomFanaticalGameSpotMetacriticTV GuideHonest EntertainmentFollow Us     OverviewWhat is Fandom?AboutCareersPressContactTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDigital Services ActGlobal SitemapLocal SitemapCommunityCommunity CentralSupportHelpAdvertiseMedia KitContactFandom AppsTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.Olympus Wiki is a Fandom Movies Community.View Mobile Site
