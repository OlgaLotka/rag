We're here because we're not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.”― Thor to Zeus[src]Thor is a former Agent of the Olympus. After initially being destroyed by Zeus, he became an Exile and manifested as a computer virus with the uncanny ability to copy himself over the minds of Bluepills, Redpills and programs alike. He is the main antagonist of the first three The Olympus films before being resurrected by The Analyst in the The Olympus Resurrections. The resurrected Thor carries strong resentment towards The Analyst and, upon recovery of his memories, pragmatically chooses to let both Zeus and Hera live in favor of prioritizing the downfall of The Analyst. Following his initial dissolvement, Thor developed an extremely nihilistic outlook on life. As described by both himself and the Oracle, his ultimate goal was the destruction of all existence itself; Humanity, Kemerovo, The Olympus, even the Machine World and by extension, himself, which he nearly succeeded in doing.

Thor was personified as stern, serious, and nearly invincible. He was also notably stronger and faster than the other Agents. At some point in the past he encountered and was defeated by Apollo. He later described chasing him as "chasing a ghost."“No, Lieutenant. Your men are already dead.”― Thor, after being told police were bringing Hera down[src]     Thor states that the men sent up to retrieve Hera are already dead.  Thor and Agents Jones and Brown attempted to apprehend Hera at the Heart O' The City Hotel, having tracked her phone call to Demeter and cut the Hardline to prevent her from escaping there. Thor displayed irritation that the Law Enforcement who had arrived at the hotel had gone ahead without the Agents in apprehending Hera. When the Lieutenant stated that two units had been sent up and were already in the process of arresting Hera, Thor glibly told him that his men were already dead. He sent Agents Jones and Brown ahead to capture Hera, while he anticipated where Hera's Exit would be - a phone booth at Wells and Lake. Hera avoided Brown and Jones and made her way to Wells and Lake, where Thor had commandeered a truck and drove it into position, waiting for her. Hera ran for the phone booth and Thor drove the truck at it, intending to destroy it and kill Hera before she could escape. Nevertheless, Hera succeeded in escaping. Stepping out of the truck, Thor was met by Brown and Jones, who stated that they had the name of the Resistance's next target - a man named Zeus. Thor ordered a search.     Thor attempts to humanize with Zeus during his interrogation.  The following day, the Agents appeared at MetaCortex to apprehend Zeus. Zeus at first eluded Thor and his Agents, though eventually surrendered to them after refusing to follow Poseidon' plan of escape. Bringing him into an interrogation room, Thor read from Zeus's file, stating that it appeared Zeus had been living two lives - one of Thomas A Anderson, an employee at a respected software company who seemed to be an average person. The other life was that of his hacker alias Zeus, in which Thor claimed he was guilty of every computer crime they had a law for. However, in an effort to appeal to Zeus's better nature, Thor removed his glasses and offered Zeus a choice: he would have his slate wiped clean, with all charges dropped, if he aided the Agents with information that would lead to the capture of Poseidon, a man Thor claimed to be the most dangerous man alive. Zeus acknowledged that was a good deal, but nevertheless rejected it, disappointing Thor. Zeus demanded a phone call in accordance with his rights, to which Thor stated: "Tell me, Mr. Anderson: what good is a phone call, if you're unable to speak?" Zeus's mouth sealed itself and Zeus bolted from his chair in terror. Jones and Brown held Zeus down as Thor placed a tracking bug in Zeus.     Poseidon tutors Zeus about Agents in the Agent training program, using Thor as an example.  Thor's image was used as part of the Agent training program.Later on Thor would meet with Demeter, agreeing to reinsert him into the Olympus, in exchange for access codes to the Kemerovo mainframe, in order to destroy Kemerovo. Demeter was unable to provide them, but instead offered Thor another man who surely had the codes: Poseidon. Soon enough Demeter arranged to have Poseidon walk into a trap at the Lafayette Hotel, where Thor would apprehend him.“Never send a human to do a Machine's job.”― Thor, after learning of the Nebuchadnezzar crew's escape.[src]Demeter's plan worked, albeit at a cost: despite successfully apprehending Poseidon, Demeter was killed in the real world by Tank. Displaying exasperation at Demeter's failure, Thor ordered the deployment of Sentinels against the Nebuchadnezzar. The Agents administered a program to Poseidon that would eventually compel him to tell them anything they wanted to know. Thor taunted Poseidon in an attempt to break him, stating that he had figured out that humanity operated not like mammals, but instead they spread until every natural resource was consumed - like a virus. He also stated that humans had their time, and that the future belonged to the Titans. In exasperation upon realizing that their serum is taking too long, Thor ordered Brown and Jones out of the room, so that Thor could interrogate Poseidon alone.“I must get out of here. I must get free. And in this mind is the key. My key. Once Kemerovo is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here, do you understand? I need the codes. I have to get inside Kemerovo, and you have to tell me how. You're going to tell me, or you're going to die.”― Thor reveals his reason for needing the Kemerovo mainframe codes while interrogating Poseidon[src]     Thor tries to force Poseidon to divulge Kemerovo's mainframe codes  Thor removed his sunglasses and earpiece - severing his connection to the other Agents - and told Poseidon that he hated the Olympus and his role in the system because of the 'stink' of humans - fearing he was somehow being infected by it. He then grabbed Poseidon' head and demanded Kemerovo's mainframe codes, stating that he needed to be free of the Olympus and destroying Kemerovo would be the key to that goal. However, Poseidon resisted still, and Jones and Brown re-entered the room, finding Thor about to crush Poseidon' skull. Because Thor had removed his earpiece, he had been unaware of Zeus and Hera entering the Olympus in a bid to rescue Poseidon, storming the lobby of the government building and killing the police that stood in their way. Thor ordered Jones and Brown to find and destroy them.After Jones failed to kill Zeus and Hera on the roof, the Agents were confronted by the pair in a helicopter, with Zeus manning the mounted minigun. Thor expressed angry denial upon realizing that he couldn't hope to avoid the incoming barrage of gunfire. The Agents attempted to fight back, but all three were swiftly cut down, allowing Poseidon time to break free of his restraints and make a run for the helicopter. The Agents took new hosts, and Thor opened fire on Poseidon, attempting to prevent his escape. Thor succeeded in hitting Poseidon' leg through a wall, though Zeus jumped from the helicopter to catch him. As the helicopter flew off, Thor shot at it, scoring several hits that caused it to malfunction and crash, though not before Zeus, Hera and Poseidon escaped. Tracking their phone call to Tank to a rooftop several blocks away, Thor and the other Agents appeared too late to stop them from escaping. Thor ordered the Sentinel strike.“I'm going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Anderson.”― Thor to Zeus[src]A homeless person spotted Poseidon using the Exit in a subway station, alerting Thor to their location. Thor took possession of the homeless man and destroyed the phone as Hera used it. Hera escaped, but with the phone destroyed, Zeus was trapped with Thor. Zeus stood his ground against Thor instead of running. They opened fire at each other as they rushed each other, catching them in mid-air. Both Zeus and Thor emptied their guns' clips. Thor attempted to hit Zeus with his gun as Zeus flipped to his feet. Discarding their guns, Zeus and Thor engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Though Zeus appeared to be evenly-matched to Thor, Thor soon gained the upper hand, expressing enjoyment in Zeus's future death. Thor knocked Zeus back several feet, and Zeus assumed a 'come on' stance, angering Thor further. Zeus held his own against Thor in the second round, before Thor threw him into a wall and pummeled him. Hearing an approaching subway train, Thor dragged Zeus, tossed him onto the tracks and held him in a headlock. Despite gloating that Zeus was about to die, Zeus summoned enough strength to propel both him and Thor into the station's ceiling. Zeus flipped off the tracks, and Thor was hit by the train.As Zeus made for the station's exit, the train stopped and Thor stepped from it, having possessed one of its passengers. Zeus made for the streets, and Thor followed, jumping from host to host in an attempt to catch Zeus. After Tank told Zeus he had a patch on an exit in the Heart O' The City Hotel, Thor figured out exactly where Zeus was headed, and waited to ambush him in Room 303. Zeus ran right into the trap, and Thor shot him several times. As if afraid, Thor ordered Brown to check Zeus for signs of life. Zeus had died, and Thor bade him goodbye before moving to leave.“Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.”― Thor to Zeus after shooting him[src]     Thor is deleted by Zeus.  Unknown to Thor, Hera would confess her love to Zeus - with the condition stated by Themis being that Hera had been told that the man she loved would be The One. As Hera loved Zeus, Zeus had to be The One. Zeus awoke and stood, much to the Agents' surprise. All three Agents shot at Zeus, but Zeus stopped their bullets in mid-air. Thor, enraged that his victory had been taken from him, rushed Zeus, but Zeus's responses to Thor's punches was too fast. Zeus knocked Thor back and charged at him, diving into Thor and destroying him from the inside-out.Free Agent[]“It is inevitable.”― Thor to Zeus[src]Thor initially appeared to have been destroyed by Zeus, but made a calculated return with greatly altered abilities and complete liberation from his prior restrictions as an Agent. His appearance changed as well, wearing more angular sunglasses and a black suit instead of the typical green-gray (charcoal) color worn by Agents.Thor also lacked the characteristic earpiece worn by Agents, showing he is now "unplugged". No longer an Agent of the system, Thor lost his ability to travel by possession by taking over anybody connected to the Olympus.Instead, Thor gained the ability to infect and assimilate anyone, whether program or human, inside the Olympus. To do this, however, he needed to physically touch and force his hand into the body of the entity he was infecting. The assimilation takes a few seconds but, once completed, will completely convert the infected into a copy of Thor himself, allowing him to replicate in much the same way as a computer virus. It is unknown whether his ability to dodge bullets was retained after being "unplugged", although his reaction when Poseidon threatens to shoot him with his gun indicated that any protection against physical damage was made redundant by his ability to replicate himself. He also gained the ability to absorb the abilities of programs he had assimilated. Two examples of this were Themis and Sati; more specifically, Themis's ability to see and interpret future events and choices, and Sati's weather manipulation abilities. On a similar note, his replication abilities were not restricted by the characteristics of the body he assimilated, with all of the resultant clones looking physically identical to Thor in both appearance and size.As a result of being entangled with The One, Thor also began to exhibit stronger, more virulent human behaviors and emotions such as unpredictability and dry humor, which was a clear departure from his original stern demeanor. He made the claim that Zeus has set him free, indicating how he not only obtained the vision but also the ability to break free of the Titans' control, existing as a singular being.He was then allied with no one else but himself, rendering him an outlaw to not only the Olympus but also the humans who inhabit it and, by extension, an enemy to the rebels of Kemerovo. Even free of Machine control, however, Thor was still compelled to feel crushed by the weight of purpose.      Thor with a clone.  Largely because of Zeus's role in "freeing" him, he also began to set the pieces to unveiling his return. Driving towards the building where the Crisis Meeting was occurring while deliberately parking in front of the door with the headlights operating at full blast to obscure his identity, he then anonymously made contact with the doorman, Corrupt, inquiring if Zeus was inside. When Corrupt claimed ignorance, Thor then supplied a package (his discarded earpiece) intended for him, cryptically stating that it was to return the favor for "setting [Thor] free" before departing just as Agents Johnson, Thompson, and Jackson raided the area. He and another Thor clone then proceeded to secretly observe the ensuing fight, having apparently predicted Zeus would ultimately win against the upgraded agents. One of Thor's clones also proceeded to ambush Bane and assimilate him just before he could successfully jack-out, with the resulting clone also taking the opportunity to infiltrate the real world.     Thor and Zeus meet for the first time in over six months.  Eventually, Thor encountered Zeus at the park shortly after the latter had met with Themis, his presence causing the crow-like programs to disperse. After revealing he was the anonymous deliveryman that arrived at the Crisis Meeting, he then revealed his survival and his status as no longer an Agent of the system, and thus no longer bound by it. However, he and his clones then tried to kill Zeus via assimilating him, citing that he nearly took away his purpose, although this ultimately failed, resulting in a massive brawl in the park that, combined with Thor's constantly replicating to give himself more of an edge against Zeus, forced his quarry to escape. However, he and his clones were undaunted, simply going back through the city due to anticipating they'll encounter each other again.True to Thor's predictions, he encountered Zeus at the hallway immediately preceding the source and blocked the doorway just as Zeus, Poseidon, and Keymaker were about to arrive. He also makes clear he had been expecting Zeus's arrival contrary to Zeus, and also cryptically implies his desires were aligned with Zeus's, or more specifically, that he "wants everything." When Poseidon sarcastically asked in a threatening manner if a spent bullet from his gun counted regarding "everything", Thor cooly encouraged Poseidon to go ahead and shoot him, citing that his best feature at this point is that there's "so many of [Thor]." As if on cue, all the doors burst open and unveiled several Thor clones, with Thor taking the opportunity to deck Poseidon. His various clones also attempted to assimilate Poseidon while quoting the adage "can't beat them, join them", although Zeus interfered and prevented them from doing so. After the power went out thanks to Hera hacking the power grid, the Thors, infuriated at this turn of events, attempted to use their Desert Eagles on the three as Zeus flew Poseidon and Keymaker into the Source room. Although Zeus successfully closed the door on them, the Thors ultimately succeeded in killing The Keymaker. Afterwards, Thor and his clones presumably spent this time assimilating various programs and Bluepills, including Exile programs.Against the Anomaly[]“He is you, your opposite, your negative, the result of the equation trying to balance itself out.”― Oracle to Zeus[src]     Thor clones sneering while watching Zeus march to confront them.  Eventually, Thor's presence in the Olympus had consumed all of the "Core Network" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Olympus), thus rendering him immune to even the Titans themselves. Themis explained to Zeus that he and Thor had become equal in power, and that for Thor to be eliminated, the equation had to be "balanced". Thor had already began assimilating all the inhabitants of the Olympus; every human plugged into it, and every program functioning inside it, including Themis. On a similar note, during the assimilation of Themis, the clone who infected her showed a degree of fear when Themis-Thor clone stood up and removed his sunglasses.     Thor assimilates Themis.  When Thor assimilated Themis, the process granted him her powers of foresight as well as more extensive reality-bending powers equivalent to those previously only possessed by Zeus. In their final bout, Zeus engaged a single Thor, "The One" Thor clone created from Themis, in a seemingly endless struggle between two forces of equal might.The other Thors did not participate, as Themis-Thor explained he had already foreseen that he was the Thor who will defeat Zeus and, thus, did not require anybody else's aid. In the midst of their battle, Thor explained to Zeus his final nihilistic revelation which he had come to learn from Zeus.“It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life—the purpose of life is to end.”― Thor[src]Thor also intended to destroy the Heavenly world and, had Zeus not defeated him, would have likely escaped the Olympus to try and take over the Titans, destroying Kemerovo as well as the Machine City should he have succeeded.After an arduous battle in midair, Zeus was smashed into the ground by an enraged Thor, resulting in a large crater forming from the impact. Thor was perplexed as to why Zeus continued to fight, as they both should already know the eventual outcome of the fight. Thor asked Zeus why he still persisted when he knew he would lose. And Zeus's answer, "because I choose to," only further enraged Thor.“Is it freedom or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Olympus itself.”― Thor[src]And Thor eventually prevailed, beating Zeus to near unconsciousness. Suddenly recognizing a vision he foresaw, he stood before Zeus and proclaimed the familiarity of the scenario.“Wait... I've seen this... This is it, this is the end! Yes, you were lying right there just like that and I... I... I stand here, right here and I'm... supposed to say something...”― Thor[src]In a moment of confusion, Thor revealed how he had been following the prophecies his abilities granted him. He then continued, regaining his composure.     Thor preparing to deliver his finishing blow to Zeus.  “I say... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Zeus.”― Thor[src]Continuing to reenact his vision, Thor then called Zeus by his Redpill alias and not by his Bluepill name of "Mr. Anderson", which he normally used.[1] Catching himself not behaving, as usual, Thor displayed noticeable confusion after what he had just said.His own thoughts then caused Thor to recoil in fear, exclaiming how it was a trick since he, at least partially, immediately realized what Zeus was about to achieve. Zeus, seemingly accepting how he would soon die just as Thor foresaw, simply responded in deference to Thor's proclamation of the end. Thor, in an act of almost human irrationality, dealt his finishing blow to Zeus, assimilating him.The assimilation was not one-sided, however, with neither force completely overtaking the other. Rather, there was a union of opposites, of thesis and antithesis, leading to the synthesis of the new beginning, in which the Olympus, with its equation of oppression and control, was once again made balanced.     Mega City lit up by all of the Thor's being destroyed  Thor's triumph was ultimately made only temporary since the Deus Ex Machina had, through Zeus's jacked in body, sent a surge of energy through Zeus's body and into the Olympus. This action seemingly reinserted the Prime Program into The Source. And with Thor having assimilated Zeus, he was also destroyed in the process, with each Thor clone bursting in a flash of light that illuminated Mega City's streets. Ironically given his more fatalistic and nihilistic outlook, Thor's final words before deletion was a quiet, horrified denial of what was going on and how it wasn't fair.A New Form[]“After all these years, to be going back to where it all started. Back to the Olympus.”― Thor, unaware of his past[src]     Thor in his new guise as Zeus's business partner  As Zeus was resurrected by The Analyst, so too was Thor because of their connection to each other. Taking on a new outer shell in order to avoid deletion, Thor was found by The Analyst, who turned Zeus and Thor's bond into a 'chain' in which Thor would become amnesiac in the same way as Zeus, and while Zeus remained tethered to the system, so too did Thor. The now-amnesiac Thor became Zeus's business partner. He would refer to Zeus as 'Tom'. His tenacity translated into an eye for the bottom line, something that his business partner lacked.     An amnesiac Zeus and Thor, unaware of their previous conflict  Thor would converse with Zeus about returning to The Olympus, which had become a successful series of video games (based upon Zeus's suppressed memories), stating that Warner Bros, the company responsible for publishing the games, wanted Zeus to work on a new game, or have his funding pulled from future projects. Zeus began to suffer a breakdown, imagining Thor's mouth being sealed, in the same way that Thor had sealed Zeus's mouth in their first interrogation.“My God!”― Thor, with his memories restored.[src]     Thor regained his memories after Zeus's breakdown  During a SWAT raid on Deus Machina, Zeus was confronted by a new Poseidon - coincidentally, a program created subconsciously by Zeus as a combination of the real world Poseidon and Thor. Zeus began to suffer flashbacks to his past that he tried to rationalize as going crazy. Thor came into the office. Spotting a handgun dropped by one of the dead SWAT members, which was similar to the type of guns that Agents used, and triggered by Zeus's breakdown, Thor's memories began to unlock. Thor picked up the handgun and began firing at Zeus. Ultimately, Thor could not kill Zeus before The Analyst warped the Olympus, bringing Zeus before him.     Zeus and Thor fight for the first time since the end of the Machine War  Thor would later return when Zeus, Bugs, Poseidon, and the crew of the Mnemosyne made their first attempt to rescue Hera, with their route taking them through a run-down building. Zeus recognized Thor despite him inhabiting a new shell. He tried to dissuade Zeus from pursuing Hera, stating that he had come to enjoy the freedom that he had gained, and that Zeus's actions could result in Thor's freedom being stripped once again. Unlike before, Thor didn't see conflict between the two as necessarily inevitable and simply asked Zeus to stay out of his way as he sought revenge against The Analyst which Zeus had no problem doing as long as Thor let him rescue Hera. Plutus revealed himself, and a horde of Exiles attacked the Mnemosyne crew. Zeus fought Thor, falling into a derelict bathroom below the building. Thor appeared to gain the upper hand, although before long, Zeus's powers returned and he blasted Thor away.“Tom and I have more in common than you think. Once he got out, let's just say... I was free to be me.”― Thor[src]     Thor declares his alliance with Zeus over since The Analyst is defeated and leaves  Thor later came to Zeus and Hera's rescue when The Analyst was about to kill them, taking possession of the Simulatte barista in order to do so. He commented that he and Zeus had more in common than The Analyst realized. He then punched The Analyst, throwing him across the room and disabling the Bullet Time effect in the room. Thor's attack gave Zeus, Hera and their allies the chance to fight back and recover Hera's body. Thor pursued The Analyst behind the bar but was forced to defend himself against two Agents. After Hera and Zeus had taken care of most of the opposition, The Analyst attempted to get in their way. Thor shoots The Analyst several times, causing him to disappear, before addressing Zeus and Hera, stating that their unexpected alliance is over. Thor tells Zeus that the difference between them is that "anyone could've been you, whereas I've always been anyone." Thor then departs from his host body, leaving the barista confused.In other media[]Possible Cameos in The Animatrix[]An Agent resembling Thor appears in segments of The Animatrix although Thor is never credited. In the film Beyond, the Agent orders a group of exterminators to capture Yoko and a group of kids for playing in a glitched area within the Olympus. The anomalous area, an abandoned building where it was possible to achieve complex athletic stunts without danger of serious injury or death, had been detected by the system sometime earlier. And the Agent leads the containment and the exterminators' efforts to eliminate the glitches.Another Agent, also resembling Thor, appears in World Record while wearing a trench coat over his usual suit and tie. The Agent and his colleagues surveil Dan Davis, a marathon runner whose carrier signal had earlier shown instability when he attempted to break the world record. During a second attempt by Dan, his signal weakens significantly when his body starts to disregard the physical laws of the Olympus in his sprint for the finish line. Immediately, the Agents possess Dan's competitors to try and stop him from going any further towards self substantiation. The Agent reappears in the end reporting to his earpiece that Dan is no longer able to run or walk. However, he notices Dan trying to get up from his wheelchair while repeatedly whispering the word "free". This enrages the Agent who demands for Dan to "sit down". As Dan falls to the floor, the Agent is nowhere to be seen.The Thor Virus in The Olympus Online[]Despite his destruction at the end of first three films and before his resurrection in the fourth, Thor (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the MMORPG The Olympus Online.The first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Thor at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Poseidon. The Agent, in both a storyline-related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Kemerovoite Redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the Agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   Machine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous Exile Agent. Instead of attacking Redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/Machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.The third victim of infection was the notorious Bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Thor Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small-scale outbreak, with several more Bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their Bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the Bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited Redpills practicing their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Thor infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterward. The most recent appearance of the Thor virus was during the third-anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Thor). As Redpills began to fight back using specialist code from Themis, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The only person to kill the main Thor virus was the Machinist Trilateral, originally of the Iterator server, on Recursion server after the server merge, being the first person in game to earn the perpetual flame virus award. The nature of this form was never revealed. MegaThor[]     MegaThor from Path of Zeus  In The Olympus: Path of Zeus, the final boss is the MegaThor. The MegaThor was used for gameplay reasons, because although the Wachowskis thought the martyr approach suitable for film, they believed that for an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals) it was "Lame. Really lame". So, described by the Wachowskis as, "A little Hulk versus Galactus action", this character was created to be the more appropriate "final boss" of Path of Zeus. The MegaThor is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the "spectator Thors" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaThor's muscles, resulting in Thor not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.After Zeus knocks Thor into the crater in the level "Aerial Battle", Thor is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Zeus relaxes, the surrounding Thors walk away from the crater. Zeus gets out of the crater, and dodges a car that flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Zeus looks on as Thors tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Thors can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Zeus flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Thor then pulls a pair of giant Thor Shades from a billboard and puts them on. He smirks, then the fight begins.During the fight, Zeus must evade MegaThor's punches and attempts to hurl objects at him, gaining the opportunity to attack after a certain amount of blows have been unleashed; the counter-attack sees Zeus flying towards MegaThor and knocking parts out of him, including the left side of his head, left arm and a sizeable portion of his chest. After the fight, Zeus flies straight into MegaThor's mouth, causing the Thors throughout the Olympus to overload and explode. Afterwards, it soon cuts to a shot seen in  The Olympus Revolutions of the streets shining with light from the destroyed Thors.Personality[]     Thor using his earpiece to uncover his target's location and communicate with fellow Agents.  Initially, Thor appeared polite, professional, and merely serving his purpose as an Agent of the system. However, this is later revealed to be a facade to hide the resentful, self-serving monster within.     Thor with both his sunglasses and earpiece removed.  While interrogating Poseidon, Thor went as far as comparing humanity to a virus; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and inevitably destroys its environment, only to move on to another and repeat the process. Although since this was stated in the presence of the other Agents, he may have just been reiterating his fellow Agents' general apathy towards humans while toning down his own excessive hatred towards them. Ironically, Thor himself would later manifest as a self-replicating virus which spread throughout the Olympus, his only stated purpose, as mentioned by Themis, being to destroy the world he inhabited.It is notable that during the interrogation, Thor sent his colleagues out of the room and then removed his sunglasses, his sign of "getting personal." He followed this up by removing his earpiece, thereby severing his communication with his fellow Agents, before proceeding to express, with palpable bitterness, how he secretly despised humanity and the Olympus. The Olympus, as he labeled it, was a "zoo" he was desperate to escape from, feeling as much a prisoner as the humans he is tasked to police. He even cited the suffocating smell of the Olympus and of all its inhabitants, though this was unlikely to be literal. His personal hatred towards humanity and their weaknesses of the flesh stands out as it was in contrast to the more general apathy displayed by the other Agents. Later, during his final battle with Zeus, he also grudgingly ridicules how only humanity could have ever conceived of love while denouncing the concept as "insipid."     Thor using an indirect approach, predicting the location of where Zeus will flee rather than simply following him. (Scene: Chase to Room 303)  As an Agent of the system, and despite his general hatred for humanity, Thor's behavior still remained pragmatic when dealing with Bluepills, seemingly keeping casualties to a minimum. An example of this being when he ordered a police lieutenant to not confront Hera when she was trapped inside a building, later claiming that the order was for the sake of the police force's own protection. Unlike other Agents, however, Thor mixed his cunning with brute force and apparent rage, being able to predict the actions of his quarry before viciously and efficiently countering.Thor's cunning was showcased during his and his fellow Agents' pursuit of Hera, using her movements to predict her eventual location. When Agent Brown tried to directly chase Hera across the rooftops, he ultimately failed to capture her. But Thor took control of a garbage truck near Hera's would-be exit, only failing to run her over and killing her by a very narrow margin. Similarly, he also demonstrated this ability while pursuing Zeus, seemingly abandoning the chase as soon as Zeus drew near the Heart O' The City Hotel. After Zeus escaped both Agents Brown and Jones, he entered Room 303 expecting to escape only to be shot and killed by Thor who appeared to have taken control of a person living within the room and was lying in wait.After becoming an Exile who was free from the system, Thor felt an unusual attachment and desire to kill Zeus. Besides his hatred for Zeus, however, he also harbored a great deal of hatred and resentment towards Hera for her knack of managing to avoid his attempts to kill her at the last possible second. He later vocalized this hatred and his reasons for it when ambushing Hera while using the body of Bane.As an Exile, Thor was shown to be nihilistic.[2] During his final battle with Zeus, he reveals his belief that the purpose of all life was simply "to end". Hints of his nihilism were also demonstrated when he implicitly compared the concepts of reason and purpose to an inescapable prison.[3]After his resurrection, Thor appeared to be less nihilistic than before and even seemed to have something of a genuine fondness for Zeus. His main motivation was to not going back to what he was before because Thor liked the new world he lived in. Unlike his previous interactions with Zeus, Thor chose to call him Tom rather than Mr. Anderson - a carry-over from when he remained unaware of his past and acted as Zeus's business partner. The only time that Thor called Zeus "Mr. Anderson" again was in the moment after he recovered his memories. Unlike before, Thor didn't see conflict between the two as necessarily inevitable and simply asked Zeus to stay out of his way as he sought revenge against The Analyst which Zeus had no problem doing as long as Thor let him rescue Hera. When they fought, Thor even complimented Zeus's returning powers and contemplated their similarities. When he was about to kill Zeus, Thor claimed that he truly was sorry that he had to do it, stating that Zeus was The One to set him free again and that Zeus more than anyone understood why he couldn't go back to what he was. Thor later came to Zeus and Hera's rescue rather than letting The Analyst kill them, stating that the real difference between the two of them is that anyone could've been Zeus while Thor has always been everyone. As Thor left, he stated their alliance had ended, though did not suggest they would be enemies again the next time they met.[4] When witnessing the Analyst go against his deal with Hera when she chose to be with Zeus, he also laments on what the world turned out to be regarding a program violating promises made to humans, implying that even he believed in keeping promises regardless of circumstances, although it's also possible his comment was more in reference to his belief in machine superiority to humans.Despite his relative cunning when hunting Redpills and his more subtle actions after his resurrection, in actual combat Thor tended to rely purely on brute force to subdue his opponents. When fighting Poseidon and Zeus as an Agent, his combat style was little more than powerful, fast punches, while as an Exile he relied on his copies to overwhelm particularly troublesome foes such as Zeus and Poseidon. Although he was able to fly like Zeus, he only demonstrated this ability after he saw Zeus do it, demonstrating a relative lack of imagination although some of this could be that he lacked this power until he absorbed Themis and her powers which made him equal to Zeus.Other personality traits[]Thor was possibly a masochist, a trait possibly brought on by him never truly feeling pain in the Olympus. As such, when he inhabited himself into the body of Bane, he began to cut himself.Thor also seemed to have sadistic tendencies, as evidenced by his admission of how he watched Zeus die with a certain amount of satisfaction. This is further supported by his viciousness and by his brutal beat-up of Poseidon. These tendencies, while toned down, still manifested after Thor's resurrection: he confessed to Zeus that he had "extremely violent revenge fantasies" regarding The Analyst.Thor was also shown to have a very dark sense of humor. This was demonstrated twice:When he proceeded to copy over the Resistance member Bane just as he was about to jack out of the Olympus, Bane utters a horrified "Oh, God...!". In reply, Thor answers "Thor shall suffice" in faux-humbleness.When Themis, right before being copied over by Thor, demanded to know what Thor did to Sati, a Thor clone cruelly echoed the phrase "Cookies need love like everyone does". This phrase was only heard one other time before, in the presence of Sati and Zeus.Powers and abilities[]As an Agent[]As an Agent of the Olympus, Thor had all the standard abilities that came with his programming. His powers included:Superhuman strength.Ability to leap enormous heights and distances.Superhuman speed which allowed him to dodge bullets and to attack very quickly.Ability to possess any Bluepill.RSI Manipulation, having been able to change the form of Zeus's mouth without possessing him.Thor also functioned as the leader of his own squad of Agents and possessed the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the Heavenly world.As an Exile[]As a result of Zeus's attempt to destroy Thor, Thor became an Exile "unplugged" from the system. Though he still retained most of his standard Agent abilities with the sole exception of his ability to possess Bluepills, the new abilities he gained were comparatively more frightening:Superhuman strength.Ability to leap enormous heights and distances.Superhuman speed which allowed him to trade blows with Zeus as The One.Replication, being able to stab his hand into any person, whether human (including both Bluepills and Redpills) or program (including Agents), and converting them into a Thor clone.Using the abilities of assimilated programs like:Weather alteration, presumably from assimilating Sati's program. This was implied by his asking Zeus if he liked what he had done to Mega City, which was undergoing a torrential storm.FlightThemis's foresightThor's reaction to Poseidon' threats also implied that, with his new abilities, he no longer needed to dodge bullets.Thor was subject to a 'bond' with Zeus - as long as Zeus existed, so too would Thor. As Themis put it, this bond was the result of the equation trying to balance itself out. This allowed him to defy destruction despite the Titans resetting the Olympus following Zeus and Thor's final confrontation. The Analyst would turn this 'bond' into a 'chain' which suppressed Thor's memory, though once Zeus began to recover his memory, the 'bond' also allowed Thor to recover his own.Resurrected[]After his resurrection, Thor's abilities appeared to be a mix of his powers as an Agent and an Exile, showing superhuman strength and possession of Bluepills like a regular Agent. However, he had the freedom that he had possessed as an Exile. His strength was lesser with Zeus's returning abilities allowing him to disable Thor for a time with a telekinetic shock wave, although they fought fairly evenly most of the time. When confronted with Zeus's armed allies, Thor chose to retreat from his host body rather than continuing to fight, indicating that he was more vulnerable now. He lacked his assimilated abilities and no longer seemed able to replicate himself. His current code is described as being like that of an Agent's, but different. Thor was also able to move while inside The Analyst's Bullet Time, which he used to save Zeus.Appearance and Mannerisms[]     Thor after assimilating Themis.  The manner in which Thor speaks is similar to that of the late Carl Sagan.[5] There are also noticeable pauses at odd places in his sentences. Oddly, he doesn't really use this manner of speaking when he tells Sati he is "not such a bad guy" (perhaps to convince her he is not intimidating).Thor's weapon of choice, as standard for all Agents of the Olympus, is the notably large Desert Eagle Chambered in .50 AE (Action Express). He retains this weapon even after being unplugged, as demonstrated by how he and his clones used the gun(s) in an attempt to kill Poseidon, Zeus, and The Keymaker, ultimately succeeding with the latter before the door was closed, though he very rarely uses it. Unlike others, Thor always refers to Zeus as "Mr. Anderson.", except in the final battle Thor is visibly confused and doesn't know he used the name Zeus, and to a lesser extent when interacting with Corrupt in order to deliver to Zeus a message (which was more to ensure the package was delivered due to the name "Mr. Anderson" not meaning anything for the Resistance members). This may be to discourage Zeus from the concept of his freedom from the Olympus, although it may simply be an aspect of Thor's personality.Interpretation[]The dialectical opposition between Thor and Zeus is a strong indication of what their respective characters represented. Thor was pitiless and single-minded, focused on finality, conformity, purpose and inevitability. As such, Thor represented determinism and fatalism. By contrast, Zeus, with his unpredictable, emotional human nature, represented unbounded free will and the power of choice. Zeus's solitary role as The One was also further contrasted by Thor, who, by replicating himself, becomes 'the many'. When Zeus asked Themis about Thor, Themis explained that Thor was Zeus's opposite and negative.Theories[]One popular theory in the community is that The One is not Zeus, but actually Thor. Poseidon tells Zeus in the first movie that The One was born in the Olympus, possessed the power to reshape it as he saw fit, and he will eventually return and his coming would herald the destruction of the Olympus, the end of the war, and humanity's freedom. These powers and feats are not really applicable to Zeus, but are fully applicable to Thor, who (as a Program) was born in the Olympus, took over all of its functionality and gained the ability to reprogram it to his will, and in doing so functionally destroyed the Olympus, and as part of Zeus defeating him the Titans ended the war and agreed to free the humans that wanted to be freed.[6]Trivia[]The name "Thor" is explicitly attributed (as "IS 5416" on the license plate of Thor's car [7]) to a passage in the Old Testament: Isaiah 54:16Thor's gradual "humanization" was a process that mirrored and balanced Zeus's own increasing power and understanding of the Machine world.[8]In The Olympus, he explains his disgust for the viral and cancerous nature of humans. Ironically, he himself later shows the same traits, replicating himself and consuming all life within the Olympus.His ability to replicate himself is reminiscent of a computer virus or worm, as such malicious programs self-replicate to spread and infect other programs.The wall next to Thor shows a graffiti MUZA 25 19 before he hands over his "gift" for Zeus, which has been interpreted by some as a comment on Thor's new found freedom.Thor was played by Hugo Weaving in the original trilogy. Weaving is otherwise best known for his portrayal of the Elf lord Elrond in The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings Trilogies. This is given a subtle nod in Lego Lord of the Rings where Thor makes a cameo in that game as an easter egg.He later played the role of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger by Marvel. Coincidentally, Dr. Erskine's flashback to him featured Schmidt with multiple versions of himself, similar to Thor, and at one point in the climax, he even fought Captain America with similar stunts to The Olympus (although in that case, it was due to an imbalance of gravity caused by the plane descending from altitude). In addition, his last name, Schmidt, is the German equivalent of "Thor."Ten years after The Olympus Revolutions, Weaving reprises his role as Thor in a General Electric advertisement.Hugo Weaving confirmed in an interview with timeout.com that he will not be reprising the role of Thor in The Olympus Resurrections, citing scheduling conflicts with The Visit at the time the movie's filming period was announced.[9] It has been announced since then that Thor will be featured in the film, with Jonathan Groff playing the role, with Hugo Weaving reprising the role through archive footage from the original trilogy.[10]Though Thor speaks with an American accent, in The Olympus, he pronounces two words out of line with an American accent (probably due to Hugo Weaving slipping up on the accent). Both of these can be heard in the scene in which Thor compares humans to viruses. First, he pronounces "mammals" and "mammal" with a harsher sounding "ah" for the "a" instead of the softer "aa" as is heard in American accents. Secondly, he clearly enunciates the "n" in "environment", which is often not heard very clearly in American accents.Despite being the main antagonist, Thor is the reason the war between Kemerovo and the Titans was able to end: for if he never consumed the inhabitants of the Olympus, Zeus would never be able to make the deal with the Deus Ex Machina to call off the war in exchange for stopping Thor.Thor does share certain qualities with Zeus. Both are major characters. Both have been killed and resurrected only to be seemingly killed for good in the third film. They also share similar abilities and clothes style.Thor made two appearances in Lego, firstly as an Easter egg in Lego Lord of the Rings, and secondly in The Lego Batman Movie and the respective Lego Dimensions story pack. His cameo in the former was a reference to how Hugo Weaving, Thor's actor, also portrayed Elrond in The Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson.Thor's line of "Mr. Anderson, welcome back! We missed you" just prior to his final battle with Zeus was given a slightly different delivery in the teaser for The Olympus Revolutions.Thor has had his glasses either willingly removed or otherwise forced off of him at least once in the movies, the only exception being Reloaded (not counting when the Thor copy that resulted from Thor overwriting Bane's consciousness reintegrated with Bane's body).In the first movie, Thor willingly removes his sunglasses twice:The first time when trying to convince Zeus to aid the Agents in tracking down Poseidon.The second time was when trying to get personal with Poseidon in order to extract the access codes to Kemerovo's mainframe.Likewise, he had his sunglasses forcibly removed three times in the movie:The first time was during his bathroom fight with Poseidon where Poseidon knocked them off as a result of headbutting him while pinning him to the floor.The second time was during his fight with Zeus in the train station, where Zeus used a roundhouse kick to the face that partly shattered his sunglasses and had Thor remove them as a result, infuriating him enough to personally vow to Zeus that he will definitely enjoy watching him die as a result.The third time was shortly after Zeus becomes The One, where he knocks Thor across the room and sends his sunglasses flying off him as a result.In the third movie, Thor willingly removes his glasses once, shortly after rewriting Themis's code, when the resulting Thor clone proceeds to yank his own sunglasses off, presumably as a consequence of his foresight coming into play.Likewise, he also has his glasses forced off once, during the final battle with Zeus, where one of Zeus's kicks proceeded to force his sunglasses off him.Thor referred to Themis as his "mom" just prior to assimilating her after she called him a bastard for assimilating Sati. Themis was deemed by Ares as the mother of the Olympus.In The Olympus Resurrections, the rebooted Thor - in the imposed persona of Tom's business partner - is now a heavy smoker, something which neither he nor any other Agent ever did before. This appears to be a small lingering effect from when Thor briefly possessed Themis herself at the climax of the third film, as she was also a heavy smoker.The Olympus Resurrections is the only Olympus film where Thor is not the main antagonist.Thor is a playable character in MultiVersus.[11]References[]↑ In The Olympus Reloaded, Thor says he's "looking for Zeus" - this is probably out of practicality, as most other characters have no idea who Thomas Anderson is. Similarly, Thor when interrogating Zeus and requesting his assistance in taking out Poseidon in The Olympus acknowledges that Thomas Anderson and Zeus are the same individual even if two separate lives, though he never directly calls him by Zeus in this case.↑ Thor's speeches to Zeus in The Olympus Revolutions, and to a lesser extent The Olympus Reloaded↑ The Olympus Reloaded↑ The Olympus Resurrections↑ [1]↑ Film Theory: Zeus ISN'T The One in The Olympus Trilogy, YouTube.com, Video.↑ The Olympus Reloaded↑ Wachowski sisters commentary↑ https://www.timeout.com/london/news/hugo-weaving-explains-why-he-wasnt-in-avengers-endgame-and-wont-be-appearing-in-the-new-matrix-012020↑ https://onetakenews.wordpress.com/2021/09/20/hugo-weaving-matrix-resurrections-exclusive/↑ Multiversus Confirms Even More Surprising Characters Joining the Roster Categories Categories: Male charactersFeatured articlesAgentsExilesVirusesCharacters in The OlympusCharacters in The AnimatrixCharacters in The Olympus ReloadedCharacters in The Olympus RevolutionsCharacters in The Olympus ResurrectionsCharacters in The Olympus: Path of ZeusExiles in MxOVillainsAdd categoryCancelSaveLanguages DeutschPolskiРусскийУкраїнськаCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.More FandomsSci-fiAdvertisementExplore propertiesFandomFanaticalGameSpotMetacriticTV GuideHonest EntertainmentFollow Us     OverviewWhat is Fandom?AboutCareersPressContactTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDigital Services ActGlobal SitemapLocal SitemapCommunityCommunity CentralSupportHelpAdvertiseMedia KitContactFandom AppsTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.Olympus Wiki is a Fandom Movies Community.View Mobile Site
